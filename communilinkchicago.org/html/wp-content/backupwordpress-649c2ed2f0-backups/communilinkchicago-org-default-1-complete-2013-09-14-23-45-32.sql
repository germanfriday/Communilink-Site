3 years ago we released a version of WordPress (<a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2010/06/thelonious/\">3.0</a>) that allowed you to pick a custom username on installation, which largely ended people using &#8220;admin&#8221; as their default username. Right now there&#8217;s a botnet going around all of the WordPresses it can find trying to login with the &#8220;admin&#8221; username and a bunch of common passwords, and it has turned into a news story (especially from companies that sell &#8220;solutions&#8221; to the problem).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I would recommend: If you still use &#8220;admin&#8221; as a username on your blog, <a href=\"http://www.digitalkonline.com/blog/change-your-wordpress-admin-username/\">change it</a>, use a <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/selecting-a-strong-password/\">strong password</a>, if you&#8217;re on WP.com <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/two-step-authentication/\">turn on two-factor authentication</a>, and of course make sure you&#8217;re up-to-date on the latest version of WordPress. Do this and you&#8217;ll be ahead of 99% of sites out there and probably never have a problem. Most other advice isn&#8217;t great &#8212; supposedly this botnet has over 90,000 IP addresses, so an IP limiting or login throttling plugin isn&#8217;t going to be great (they could try from a different IP a second for 24 hours).</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 Apr 2013 23:55:11

the release of BuddyPress 1.7 just a few days ago, and with almost 1.5 million downloads behind us, I wanted to take the time to remind everyone about what&#8217;s gone into improving BuddyPress recently, and to reassure everyone that it&#8217;s okay to update.</p>\n<p>In the early days of BuddyPress, things were in flux. Andy and I were furiously building components and features, deprecating code, refactoring the way things worked, and generally tearing up the codebase over and over again. It helped us build a great foundation, but it made updating to the next version a scary and frustrating experience. To those that remember those days, I apologize; to everyone else, I&#8217;m sorry you missed out on the fun. <img src=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p>Whenever your WordPress installation checks to see if BuddyPress needs an update, the WordPress.org Extend API remembers the current version of BuddyPress that you&#8217;re running. This is how we know (with relative accuracy) approximately how many of what versions are out in the wild, and it&#8217;s also how we generated the pinwheel below, taken from the Stats page from WordPress.org Extend:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_161350\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-161350   \" alt=\"Active BuddyPress Versions\" src=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-11-at-3.18.43-PM.png\" width=\"576\" height=\"283\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Every color of the rainbow is clearly represented</p></div>\n<p>Despite the pretty colors, this pie chart is actually a little scary. There are so many old and outdated installations of BuddyPress out there, not taking advantage of the neat new features, and not running the most stable and secure code available. The irony is, this is largely our fault.</p>\n<p>These days, BuddyPress is a 1 click update in your WordPress dashboard, and we&#8217;ve built a bunch of API&#8217;s that allow third party plugin developers to write plugins that won&#8217;t break when BuddyPress needs an update. We&#8217;ve spent a large part of the past 2 years reinforcing the foundation we invested in, so that no one needs to be afraid to update BuddyPress ever again.</p>\n<p>Starting with BuddyPress 1.8, the core team will be focusing our efforts on including automated tests with each enhancement and critical bug fix, to help ensure that each future release gets more stable than the release before it. Boone Gorges and Paul Gibbs both donated huge amounts of labor building a test suite that is already committed into our development branch, just days after BuddyPress 1.7 was packaged up. Their dedication towards making BuddyPress stable and amazing for everyone is unwavering, and their contributions are truly awesome.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re running an old version of BuddyPress, I urge you to check out and update to BuddyPress 1.7. It&#8217;s the culmination of thousands of hours of effort, and is the most stable, secure, and performant version of BuddyPress yet. Help us change that pinwheel into more of a Pac-Man or a circle.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Apr 2013 21:02:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"John James Jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"Andrew Nacin: Keynoting php[tek] in Chicago, May 14-17\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"http://nacin.com/?p=4090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"http://nacin.com/2013/04/11/tek13-php-conference-keynote/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3466:\"<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce <strong>I&#8217;m giving a keynote address at <a href=\"http://tek.phparch.com/\">php[tek] 2013</a></strong>.

There&#8217;s a lot WordPress has learned over the years, so I&#8217;ve been searching through the codebase and old commit messages, as well as compiling a ton of data and statistics. If you have anything you think might help, please <a href=\"http://gravatar.com/nacin\">contact me</a>. Here&#8217;s the full talk description:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<strong>WordPress is Everywhere: Extreme Portability as a Double-Edged Sword</strong></p>\n<p>WordPress has tens of millions of users worldwide and powers over a fifth of new sites. But such a large and diverse user base presents unique challenges, and as it approaches its tenth birthday, the WordPress codebase is showing its age. So why is it so ubiquitous?</p>\n<p>The answer lies not in its UI, UX, ecosystem, or community, though those are certainly among its strengths. The answer lies instead in a core philosophy that holds the user above all else.</p>\n<p>This user-centric design starts not with the interface, but rather with the code itself. Developers should approach software development with an unwavering promise they will deal with the nonsense instead of passing it off to the user.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress positions might seem draconian and inflexible. Backwards compatibility is almost never broken. The technical requirements appeal to lowest common denominators. But because the project maintainers deal with all the pain — technical debt, difficulties with PHP, working on as many server configurations (and misconfigurations) as possible — its users don’t have to. Thanks to the WordPress project’s portability efforts, you can pick a web host or a PHP configuration at random and WordPress will run on it. Because of this, adoption has soared.</p>\n<p>The way WordPress operates is not for everyone. But whether your projects are used by 10 users, or 10 million, it may help you to see your code in an entirely new light.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tickets are <a href=\"http://tek.phparch.com/\">still available</a>.

Version 2.1 of WordPress for Windows Phone is out and adds some exciting new features.</p>\n<p>We’re happy to announce that you can now get comment push notifications on your Windows Phone (OS 7.5+) which enables you to moderate comments from wherever you happen to be at the time. With 2.1 you also get a rich text editor, making it much easier to write longer posts having to deal with any HTML code.</p>\n<p>Read on to learn what’s new or update/download version 2.1 from the Windows Phone Store right now by clicking below.</p>\n<p class=\"download\"><a href=\"http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=5f64ad85-f801-e011-9264-00237de2db9e\"><strong>Download App</strong>WordPress for Windows Phone</a><span class=\"download-info\">Supported: WordPress.com or self-hosted WordPress (v. 2.9+)</span></p>\n<h3>Rich Text Editor</h3>\n<p>Now you finally have the ability to use a rich text editor when creating or editing a post or page. The new editor has easy to access styling options beneath the keyboard and in the app menu, these include bulleted/numbered lists, bold, underline, and italic text. You&#8217;ll also find a handy link helper among the text editing tools.</p>\n<h3>Comment Push Notifications</h3>\n<p>If you have a WordPress.com blog (or a self-hosted blog with the <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\">Jetpack plugin</a>) added to the app, you can now opt in to receive push notifications for new comments. This makes it easier than ever to keep up with your readers and moderate comments while on the go. You&#8217;ll get push notifications for new comments only and viewing a notification takes you right to the comment within the app. From there you can easily respond and moderate like usual.</p>\n<h3>Stability Improvements</h3>\n<p>In addition to the new features, we’ve worked hard on making the app even more stable. In total, almost <a href=\"http://windowsphone.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=Push+Notifications+and+Content+Editor\" target=\"_blank\">40 bugs and crashes</a> have been fixed in this release.</p>\n<h3>Screenshots</h3>\n<a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/version-2-1/#gallery-429-1-slideshow\">Click to view slideshow.</a>\n<h3>Contributors</h3>\n<p>The following contributors have worked on this release of WordPress for Windows Phone:  <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/aerych\">aerych</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/isaackeyet\">isaackeyet</a>, and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/daniloercoli\">daniloercoli</a>.</p>\n<h3>Get Involved!</h3>\n<p>We now have a feature-driven release cycle, meaning that updates will come faster and focus on single features and enhancements.

We&#8217;ll show off a few of our favorites below. Want to see a full changelog for 1.7? Check it out <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/releases/version-1-7/\">on the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Theme Compatibility</em></p>\n<p>BuddyPress&#8217;s social features add new kinds of content to your WordPress site: groups, profiles, and so on. Until now, displaying that content has required building or finding a BP-compatible theme &#8211; one of the biggest hurdles to using BuddyPress. Version 1.7 makes this a thing of the past. Using a feature we call &#8220;theme compatibility&#8221;, BuddyPress can display its content within the context of any WordPress theme &#8211; no modifications required. Here are a few screenshots showing BP running on a few popular themes:</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_160342\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-twentytwelve.png\"><img src=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-twentytwelve-150x150.png\" alt=\"Twenty Twelve\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-160342\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Twenty Twelve</p></div> <div id=\"attachment_160343\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-coraline.png\"><img src=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-coraline-150x150.png\" alt=\"Coraline\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-160343\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Coraline</p></div> <div id=\"attachment_160344\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-superstore.png\"><img src=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/bp-superstore-150x150.png\" alt=\"Woo Superstore\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-160344\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Woo Superstore</p></div></p>\n<div> </div>\n<p>Not satisfied with the way it looks out of the box? Not a problem. BuddyPress still provides a sophisticated, modular templating system, which you can easily customize in your own theme. Theme developers and designers can learn much more about theme compat on <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/theme-development/a-quick-look-at-1-7-theme-compatibility/\">the BuddyPress codex</a>.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<p><em>Group Administration</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_160321\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/dashboard.png\"><img src=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/dashboard-300x216.png\" alt=\"Group Administration in BuddyPress 1.7\" width=\"150\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-160321\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Group Administration in BP 1.7</p></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve run a BuddyPress-powered community site, you know that groups are a powerful way for members to connect. But there&#8217;s been no way for site administrators to manage groups. BP 1.7 introduces a brand new set of Group Administration panels on your WordPress Dashboard. Now BP admins can bulk-delete groups, edit group settings, and manage group membership without ever leaving wp-admin.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<p><em>A Better Installation Experience</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_160328\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/about.png\"><img src=\"http://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2013/04/about-150x150.png\" alt=\"About Screen\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-160328\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">About Screen</p></div>\n<p>BuddyPress makes it easy to add social features to your site, and BP 1.7 streamlines the process more than ever. We&#8217;ve removed the installation wizard in favor of a totally automated setup &#8211; just hit Activate, and we&#8217;ll handle the rest. On new installations, only the Activity and Extended Profiles components are activated, helping you to start small and grow your community features bit by bit. And, following in WordPress&#8217;s footsteps, we&#8217;ve added About and Credits screens, helping you to get up to date on the BuddyPress project.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<h3>Springtime Goodies</h3>\n<p>BuddyPress 1.7 is codenamed &#8220;Totonno&#8221;, after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totonno%27s\">the legendary Brooklyn pizza joint</a>. Totonno&#8217;s is just a few blocks from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coney_Island_Cyclone\">the Cyclone</a> and the Coney Island boardwalk, and there&#8217;s no better end to a lovely spring day than to indulge in what may be the world&#8217;s greatest pepperoni pie. With spring finally coming to Brooklyn, we think it&#8217;s appropriate to honor a pizza institution with what we think will be a watershed BuddyPress release.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<h3>The BuddyPress Community Rocks</h3>\n<p>Hundreds of developers, designers, and community volunteers have put thousands of hours into this version of BuddyPress.

For the first installment, check out the new <code>shortcode_atts_{$shortcode}</code> filter. The <code>shortcode_atts()</code> function now accepts a third parameter — the name of the shortcode — which enables the running of this filter. All of the core shortcodes now pass this parameter.</p>\n<p>This filter passes three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>$out</code> — the output array of shortcode attributes</li>\n<li><code>$pairs</code> — the array of accepted parameters and their defaults.</li>\n<li><code>$atts</code> — the input array of shortcode attributes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at what we can do with this. One thing is that you can dynamically set or override shortcode values. You an also define new ones, and transpose them into accepted ones. Let&#8217;s look at the &#8220;gallery&#8221; shortcode for example. What if there was a gallery of images that you would reuse. Instead of picking the images each time, you could have a plugin that gives that set of attachment IDs a shortcut name. Then you could do <code>[gallery foo=my-gallery-name]</code>, which the plugin would convert to a list of IDs. Or, you could enforce a certain number of gallery columns on the fly. Let someone set it theme-wide, without having them go back and change their shortcodes.</p>\n<p>What other uses can you think of?</p>\n<p>Now, if you&#8217;re a plugin or theme author who provides their own shortcodes, you should immediately start providing this third parameter to your <code>shortcode_atts()</code> calls (since it is an extra parameter, you can do this without a WordPress version check). Maybe it&#8217;ll reduce the number of times people need to fork your code just to add an option to your shortcode!</p>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3975/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/3975/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=3975&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 05 Apr 2013 03:12:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.6 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2547\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-3-6-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4076:\"<p>WordPress 3.6 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n<p>This is software still in development and <strong>we <em>really</em> don’t recommend that you run it on a production site</strong> — set up a test site just to play with the new version. To test WordPress 3.6, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.6-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a> (zip).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been working for nearly three months and have completed all the features that are slated for this release. This is a bit of a change from the betas of previous release cycles. I felt very strongly that we shouldn&#8217;t release a beta if we were still working on completing the main features. This beta is <strong>actually a beta</strong>, not an alpha that we&#8217;re calling a beta. If you are a WordPress plugin or theme developer, or a WordPress hosting provider, you should absolutely start testing your code against this new version <strong>now</strong>. More bugs will be fixed, and some of the features will get polished, but we&#8217;re not going to shove in some big new feature. We&#8217;re ready for you to test it, so jump in there! The more you test the beta, the more stable our release candidates and our final release will be.</p>\n<p>As always, if you think you’ve found a bug, you can post to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. Or, if you’re comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/\">file one on the WordPress Trac</a>. There, you can also find <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5\">a list of known bugs</a> and <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=component&milestone=3.6\">everything we&#8217;ve fixed</a> so far.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new in 3.6:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Post Formats: </strong> Post Formats now have their own UI, and theme authors have access to templating functions to access the structured data.</li>\n<li><strong>Twenty Thirteen:</strong> We&#8217;re shipping this year&#8217;s default theme in our first release of the year. Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you&#8217;re saving, you won&#8217;t lose the your post.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking: </strong> See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Nav Menus: </strong> Nav menus have been simplified with an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for  bulk-assigning menus to locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisions:</strong> The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that &#8220;scrubs&#8221; through history, and two-slider range comparisons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong> You make WordPress awesome(er). One of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with existing plugins and themes. But we need your help. <strong>Please test your plugins and themes against 3.6.</strong> If something isn&#8217;t quite right, please let us know. (Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) If you&#8217;re a forward-thinking theme developer, you should be looking at implementing the new Post Format support in some of your themes (look to Twenty Thirteen for inspiration).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to your feedback. If you break it (i.e. find a bug), please report it, and if you’re a developer, try to help us fix it. We&#8217;ve already had more than 150 contributors to version 3.6 — it&#8217;s not too late to join the party!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 04 Apr 2013 17:25:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Mark Jaquith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Dougal Campbell: CodePoet Interview\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"http://dougal.gunters.org/?p=72513\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/04/04/dougal-campbell-codepoet-interview/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1589:\"<div class=\"featured-image align-right\"><img width=\"164\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://geekramblings.gunters.netdna-cdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/codepoet-logo.png?9bb111\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"CodePoet Logo\" /></div><!--\narticle.tag-codepoet div.featured-image img{background-color: #333;}\n-->\n<p>I was honored to be chosen for an <a title=\"It\'s me!\" href=\"http://build.codepoet.com/2013/04/04/dougal-campbell-interview/\">interview on CodePoet</a>.

Heading into 2008 we <a href=\"http://blog.gravatar.com/2008/03/14/big-changes-afoot/\">rewrote it in PHP</a>, and ever since then, it&#8217;s been using the same integrated user system as WordPress.com for accounts.

many of the present readers might know me very well, and that in part, is the reason that I have made the decision to transfer WLTC to more willing and presently capable hands. I am a stranger on my blog and the time has come for me to make sure that this blog, its contents and its knowledge are archived and preserved and maybe rejuvenated at a later time.</p>\n<p>I delved into blogging tools back in 2004 when I started my Masters degree in CS. I wanted some code to mess around with in my free time and everyone was talking about blogging. I looked into a variety of tools, built a small Linux server for myself at home, and installed a few of the tools that were freely available at that time. I had a heck of a time getting a hold of MT (Moveable Type, the most well-known name) and then found b2 by sheer luck. I loved the cool look of Michael&#8217;s blog and the people involved in the tool seemed to be open to comments and replied warmly to my emails and questions. Through the b2 forums I heard about WordPress and proceeded to install it on my own. To my astonishment, it worked without a hitch and I was blogging away in no time. I started looking through the code to understand how it worked and it drew me in every step of the way.</p>\n<p>Within a few months of installing WordPress, I started to take part in the forums and wrote a few plugins and created some &#8220;hacks&#8221; for the tool. I even gained some notoriety with my MT VS WP post and that&#8217;s when the WordPress ecosphere started to look very attractive to me. I did not do this to seek attention, but I was getting a lot of attention and I was loving it. I believe that was when Matt first noticed me and we exchanged some emails and chatted with each other. With every month and with every release of WordPress I was getting more involved. At some point I realized that I could not do it alone and hired a few interested people to help me write posts and the blog started to get popular. I brought on some advertisers to help me offset costs. Matt gave me and my blog the highest honor of being included in the WordPress Planet and that&#8217;s when things really started to happen for this blog. I also started a WordPress Job blog (http://jobs.wordpress.net) which I still curate and I got involved in WordPress evangelism. Somewhere within this time, Matt had asked me to work for him at the new company he was starting and I had to turn him down because of visa restrictions and because I wanted to finish school (I kick myself every time I think about that).</p>\n<p>WordPress started to mature and WordCamps started to happen. I graduated from school with a Master&#8217;s Degree in Computer Science and found a job. I wanted to stay involved but it was getting bigger than I could handle. I could either dive in and get into WordPress and the blogging world, or I could focus on my job, career and family. I decided to choose the latter. I still wanted to loosely be involved with WordPress and things went well for a couple of years with me being casually involved. I even visited and spoke at a couple of WordCamps.</p>\n<p>When my son Lucien was born, all my time and attention was exhausted on him. I could not spend any time with WordPress or blogging at all. In addition to my growing family, I was diagnosed with a serious health condition just as I was starting a new job and moving to a new city. Needless to say, the blog was the last thing on my mind. James, who has been the sole author and curator for a long time, was my winning hand and just a fantastic helper and well wisher. He has kept things running for a long time and I have had no complaints.</p>\n<p>But I have found very little time to come back and spend with my old friends, Weblog Tools Collection and WordPress. I do not want this blog&#8217;s content and conversations to be lost or forgotten because of my neglect. I am hoping this move will help it live on as an archive, or find new lifeblood in another form. I know that it is in the right hands.</p>\n<p>So Adios and Gracias. I hope to see you in another blog, and take part in another conversation with you someday. It has been a wonderful journey and I appreciate everything that has taken place because of WordPress and every bit of help and encouragement that has been provided to me by so many of you. So thank to my wonderful audience of many years, thanks to my advertisers, thanks to my authors and finally thanks to Matt and to WordPress for making my life so much more fulfilling and successful.</p>\n<p>Peace on Earth, Goodwill to All, And to All a Goodnight!</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/NRKA8GMV-fA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 13:41:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Mark Ghosh\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Weblog Tools Collection: Where to Find WordPress News\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12846\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/ah3QRPNnlhs/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2837:\"<p>The landscape of news has changed so much over the last few years that news about a particular topic or platform is readily available to anyone within an instant. With <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">WordPress</a>, I imagine that could be one of the perks of <a href=\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2012/08/08/the-state-of-the-word-in-2012/\">powering over 16% of the web</a>, but it&#8217;s true that news is becoming incredibly accessible. In short, news is everywhere.</p>\n<p>Speaking of WordPress in general, you can of course acquire official direct news from <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress News</a>, but you can also take a peak behind the curtain and follow news in the making at <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org\">Make WordPress.org</a>. Though it&#8217;s only specific to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a> blogging platform, <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com\">WordPress.com News</a> is also worth watching for WordPress development news, as WordPress.com users often get access to new WordPress features before they&#8217;re released, so you&#8217;ll be able to try new features rather than just read about them.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s more news than just direct official news, like I said earlier, it&#8217;s everywhere. You could subscribe to every general news site, every core developer&#8217;s personal blog, every premium theme shop, and every plugin developer, but why not subscribe to a few curated news sources instead? I guess you could call <a href=\"http://planet.wordpress.org\">WordPress Planet</a> the official curated news source, but it&#8217;s really just a collection of all news items from a particular set of curated blogs. For specific news items curated from sources through the entire WordPress community, subscribe to <a href=\"http://poststat.us\">Post Status</a>, and don&#8217;t neglect the power of allowing the folks you follow on <a href=\"http://twitter.com\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://plus.google.com\">Google+</a>, and/or <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> to curate news for you.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the WordPress community, you should <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress\">get involved</a> if you aren&#8217;t already. If you don&#8217;t even use WordPress yet, it&#8217;s time to get started <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress\">with either WordPress.org</a> or <a href=\"http://learn.wordpress.com/get-started/\">with WordPress.com</a>, share your thoughts with the world, and maybe spread some WordPress news on your blog too.</p>\n<p>The news is out there, and it&#8217;s well within your reach. If you can&#8217;t find the news, it&#8217;s time to make your own.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/ah3QRPNnlhs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Mar 2013 00:05:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"James\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Plugin Releases for 3/30\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12837\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/-vmyakR-BnA/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1089:\"<h3>New plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gc-message-box/\"><strong>GC Message Box</strong></a> allows you to highlight your key message(s) in smart ways within articles and blog posts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-social-icons/\"><strong>Simple Social Icons</strong></a> allows you to insert social icons in any widget area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://askwebexpert.com/stick-it/\"><strong>Stick It</strong></a> allows you to stick the navigation menu in any theme to the top of browser window.</p>\n<h3>Updated plugins</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\"><strong>Jetpack</strong></a> allows you to supercharge your WordPress site with powerful features previously only available to <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a> users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.milandinic.com/wordpress/plugins/nav-menu-images/\"><strong>Nav Menu Images</strong></a> enables uploading of images for nav menu items on the menu edit screen.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/-vmyakR-BnA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Mar 2013 14:00:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"James\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Matt: (Un)organized Consumption\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=42334\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"http://ma.tt/2013/03/unorganized-consumption/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:387:\"<p><a href=\"http://writingthroughthefog.com/2013/03/09/on-unorganized-consumption/\">On (Un)organized Consumption</a> by Automattician Cheri Lucas. &#8220;I stopped using Instapaper.

asking for government favors one day and scolding them for meddling in the free market the next.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Lower our payroll taxes because &#8230; innovation.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Drop that antitrust inquiry because &#8230; innovation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But for all the funding announcements, product launches, media attention and wealth creation, most of Silicon Valley doesn&#8217;t concern itself with aiming &#8220;almost ridiculously high.&#8221; It concerns itself primarily with getting people to click on ads or buy slightly better gadgets than the ones they got last

height=\"517\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-1402\" /></a>We&#8217;re pleased as punch to announce that WordPress for iOS 3.5 is now available in the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?ls=1&mt=8\">App Store</a>. The dev team focused on the content editor for this release, which adds some very handy new features:</p>\n<h3>Draft previews</h3>\n<p>We know that publishing your very best stuff is important, and you should be able to see what your post or page will look like <em>before</em> you publish. Now, in version 3.5 of WordPress for iOS, you can preview your drafts! Just tap the preview &#8220;eye&#8221; tab while drafting your post or page to see the post as it will appear on your WordPress site after you hit publish.</p>\n<p>If you have a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design\">responsive</a> WordPress theme the preview will show what your post looks like on a mobile device.</p>\n<h3>Autosave</h3>\n<p>Thanks to a new Autosave feature, your site&#8217;s content is safer than ever before. Now, when you edit a draft in the app, you&#8217;ll notice a small &#8220;Autosaved ✓&#8221; message appear as you type. The draft is instantly saved locally, and if you have a reliable Internet connection at the time, it will autosave online to your WordPress site, too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/wpios-3-5-autosave1.jpg?w=420&h=188\" alt=\"Version 3.5 of WordPress for iOS: Autosave\" width=\"420\" height=\"188\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1395\" /></p>\n<h3>More improvements and bug fixes</h3>\n<p>This release also includes improvements for WordPress.com and Jetpack notifications, as well as fixes for crashes and other bugs. You can check out all the changes <a href=\"http://ios.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=02%2F11%2F13&daysback=6&authors=&ticket=on&milestone=on&changeset=on&wiki=on&update=Update\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The crash on launch that some of you were seeing has been fixed in this release.</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>\n<p>We want to continue making your mobile blogging experience better and better! While the dev team is currently deciding what to work on for version 3.6, these next items are high on our list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rich Text Editor</li>\n<li>Improved media management</li>\n<li>Sharing to the app from third-party apps and services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to keep up with the latest happenings in the WordPress mobile world?

This bug was reported and researched by Rob Begic, and fixed by the BuddyPress core team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress/\">Download 1.6.5</a> or visit Dashboard &rarr; Updates in your administration area to update now.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 23 Mar 2013 20:53:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"John James Jacoby\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases for 3/23\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12813\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/RRyaMSkB1LI/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1260:\"<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/memori-jingga\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12814\" alt=\"screenshot\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/screenshot5.png?resize=150%2C150\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/memori-jingga\"><strong>Memori Jingga</strong></a> is a responsive, clean, and simple theme.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/rockers\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12815\" alt=\"screenshot-1\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/screenshot-15.png?resize=150%2C150\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/rockers\"><strong>Rockers</strong></a> is a responsive theme with a clean design.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/satu\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-12816\" alt=\"screenshot-2\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/weblogtoolscollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/screenshot-23.png?resize=150%2C150\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/satu\"><strong>Satu</strong></a> is an elegant single-column responsive theme.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~4/RRyaMSkB1LI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 23 Mar 2013 14:00:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"James\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Weblog Tools Collection: WordCamp San Francisco 2013 Dates Announced\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=12807\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP/~3/tdYxbhgsXyo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:859:\"<p>The dates <a href=\"http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org/2013/03/22/wordcamp-sf-2013-announcement/\">have been announced</a> for <a href=\"http://2013.sf.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp San Francisco 2013</a>, an event which is often heralded as the annual <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> conference.</p>\n<p>WordCamp San Francisco 2013 will be held on July 26 and 27 at <a href=\"http://goo.gl/maps/rT6ou\">the Mission Bay Conference Center</a> with a Developer Hack Day on July 28.

The idea is simple: show posts that comprise a single overall story/topic in a timeline. Then link to that timeline from the posts so that your readers have a chance to get more historical context about a post without you having to link back to 20 previous posts.</p>\n<p>Here are some example threads:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/social\">Social</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/hard-drive-recovery\">My Hard Drive Recovery Saga</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/twitter-tools\">Twitter Tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/passwords\">Passwords</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/weight-loss\">Weight Loss</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see on this site, the thread timeline is responsive and retina/HiDPI ready. Also included is a sidebar widget to show recently active threads and a shortcode so that you can embed a thread timeline in a page.</p>\n<p>Give it a spin &#8211; I hope it works out well for you!</p>\n<p>A quick note about support: As this is a free plugin released under the GPL I am offering only &#8220;Product Support&#8221; for this plugin. That means I will do my best to fix bugs and usabiity issues that are posted on the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">WordPress support forums</a>. Contrast this with &#8220;User Support&#8221; which we offer for all of <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a>&#8216;s commercial products.

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you&#8217;re saving, you won&#8217;t lose the your post.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking: </strong> See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Nav Menus: </strong> Nav menus have been simplified with an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for  bulk-assigning menus to locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisions:</strong> The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that &#8220;scrubs&#8221; through history, and two-slider range comparisons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong> You make WordPress awesome(er). One of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with existing plugins and themes. But we need your help. <strong>Please test your plugins and themes against 3.6.</strong> If something isn&#8217;t quite right, please let us know. (Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) If you&#8217;re a forward-thinking theme developer, you should be looking at implementing the new Post Format support in some of your themes (look to Twenty Thirteen for inspiration).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to your feedback. If you break it (i.e. find a bug), please report it, and if you’re a developer, try to help us fix it. We&#8217;ve already had more than 150 contributors to version 3.6 — it&#8217;s not too late to join the party!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-3-6-beta-1/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 3.5.1 Maintenance and Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 22:23:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:359:\"WordPress 3.5.1 is now available.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/\">3.4</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/\">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href=\"http://ios.wordpress.org/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"http://android.wordpress.org/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/\">Blackberry</a>, <a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/\">Windows Phone</a>, <a href=\"http://nokia.wordpress.org/\">Nokia</a>, and <a href=\"http://webos.wordpress.org/\">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/\">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">core</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/support/\">forum support</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/\">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit\">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href=\"http://sopastrike.com/numbers/\">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans. If you didn&#8217;t make it to a WordCamp this year, maybe it can be one of your new year resolutions: <a href=\"http://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">check the schedule</a> to find one near you!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/2012-a-look-back/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"WordPress 3.5 “Elvin”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Dec 2012 16:54:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2517\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:363:\"It&#8217;s the most wonderful time of the year: a new WordPress release is available and chock-full of goodies to delight bloggers and developers alike.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.5\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory.

I&#8217;m incredibly proud of this and wanted to share some of our learnings in this post, as well as announce some changes.</p>\n<h2>Some stats on our website reviews</h2>\n<p>I started doing these website reviews in 2010, finishing 42 of them in that year. In 2011, we finished 99 website reviews, in 2012 it grew to 329. You can see this line is going up, and quite fast. These site reviews weren&#8217;t all for the same type of site, 370 of the 500 were WordPress sites, 60 were Magento, and 50 were other eCommerce sites, some of which were WordPress as well. The remainder were other types of sites, including Drupal and Joomla installs.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-64935\" alt=\"The Yoast Website Review team, from left to right: Michiel, Joost and Thijs\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/yoast-website-review-team-250.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" />These numbers, to me, are mind blowing. I&#8217;d never have thought I&#8217;d sell so many of these reviews and that I&#8217;d need a team around me, as I do today, to do them. The &#8220;funny&#8221; thing: I&#8217;m absolutely certain that the quality of our site reviews has gone up just as much over time. We&#8217;ve become better and faster at analyzing problems and proposing simple and to the point solutions. Also, every site gets seen by at least two people now, almost always three, which makes sure that we don&#8217;t miss important things.</p>\n<h2>SEO: Penguin &amp; Panda</h2>\n<p>Google is good for our business in many ways. We often get called upon to help people understand why they&#8217;d suffer from Penguin or Panda type drops of traffic. I can honestly say that sites almost invariably deserved the &#8220;slap&#8221; they got from either of these updates, and I say that knowing that we&#8217;ve seen more than 200 now. Sometimes it&#8217;s tough, as the sites that &#8220;win&#8221; because of a site losing might be even worse, but I&#8217;ll stand by what I said: the sites I have reviewed that got hit, deserved it.</p>\n<p>There were two exceptions I can remember were instead of reviewing the site, I forwarded people on to Google and asked Google to fix the false positive. Of course there have been some minor errors, but overall, forcing these people to improve their sites is &#8220;a good thing&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>Some of the other things most sites get wrong</h2>\n<p>I thought it&#8217;d be fun to dive in a bit and see what kind of issues we talk about the most, as every word in a review is decided upon by the reviewer, this isn&#8217;t as easy as it may seem as it meant I had to do some textual analysis here and there. But, I&#8217;ve compiled a small list of topics that we often address in these reviews. These were not, in most cases the most important things to fix in those sites, it&#8217;s just that a <em>lot</em> of people seem to be doing them wrong.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>404 pages</strong><br />\nIt baffles me in how many reviews this came up, so few people spend time making a proper 404 page&#8230; I&#8217;ve written about this quite extensively, this post about <a href=\"http://yoast.com/404-error-pages-wordpress/\">404s for WordPress</a> is probably the best / most interesting, even when you&#8217;re not on WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Subscription options</strong><br />\nThis is probably due to us reviewing a lot of WordPress sites / blogs, but we very often find that people are missing out on lots of subscribers by not having good subscribe widgets or even altogether lacking an email newsletter.</li>\n<li><strong>Responsive websites</strong><br />\nIf you&#8217;re serious about being on the web, whether to make money or to inform, you need to think about the different devices people will use to access your site, your content, your products. Rarely over the last few years did we find a site that had done this really well. Which is funny, especially for WordPress sites, because with good themes like a lot of the <a title=\"Genesis\" href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-theme/genesis/\">Genesis</a> based themes around, having a responsive site doesn&#8217;t need to be expensive.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal Search<br />\n</strong>Internal search often left a lot to be desired on the websites we reviewed. In a way, this isn&#8217;t that surprising: WordPress internal search just plain sucks (this <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-search/\">old article</a> from me on making it suck less is still relevant) and most other CMSes, including Magento, don&#8217;t exactly shine in that area. On the other hand: setting up a Google Custom Search Engine is <em>not</em> that hard&#8230;</li>\n<li><strong>Keyword usage and internal linking</strong><br />\nThe last thing that I find we often make remarks about is the usage of keywords. Now these remarks go in all directions, but one thing is clear: simple principles like the <a href=\"http://yoast.com/cornerstone-content-rank/\">Cornerstone Content</a> principle are often misunderstood. Quite a number of the sites we made remarks about in this area had the keyword they wanted to rank for in the title of over a dozen pages. Think to yourself: how would Google decide which of these pages to show as the top result? Are you making that clear?</li>\n<li><strong>Call to Action<br />\n</strong>Very often we find sites that <em>do, </em>in fact, rank rather well for certain terms, but make hardly any money from that fact. This is often true because they lack a clear call to action. Michiel&#8217;s article about <a href=\"http://yoast.com/call-to-action/\">the call to action on your homepage</a> is a good example of the kind of advice we tend to give.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see, the range of topics we discuss is quite broad, covering UX, design, SEO, conversion rate optimization and more. Over time, we&#8217;ve been spending more time on these reviews &#8211; even though our analysis of individual issues became faster &#8211; just because the breadth <em>and</em> depth of our reviews increased. Which is why I&#8217;m announcing the following:</p>\n<h2>Website Review price going up Feb 1st</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve decided to raise the price of our <a href=\"https://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/\">website review service</a> to €749, up €154 from our current €595 price point, effective February 1st. The reason for this is simple: we&#8217;re spending more and more time on these reviews and the follow-up questions, and feel the price isn&#8217;t justifying that anymore. Because we know that a lot of people plan on these, we wanted to give you a bit of notice.</p>\n<p>I realize this might mean that we sell quite a few reviews in the coming week and a half.

The vast majority of people only use the plugin on one site, so reducing it in price for those people made sense, while charging more for people using it on more sites seemed reasonable.</p>\n<p>So we now offer 3 licenses to the plugin, much in the same way as <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-plugin-review/gravity-forms/\">Gravity Forms</a> and <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> extensions work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>personal, for a single site at $69;</li>\n<li>professional, for up to 5 sites at $129;</li>\n<li>agency, for unlimited sites at $249.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-62839\" alt=\"Yoast_avatar_Thijs_def\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Yoast_avatar_Thijs_def-130x300.png\" width=\"130\" height=\"300\" />Everyone who has bought the plugin at the old price of $89 is in luck: your license is and will remain unlimited. We will use the same pricing model for our upcoming Local SEO module.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you&#8217;ve emailed our support email address, you might have &#8220;met&#8221; the new addition to our team: my little brother <a href=\"http://yoast.com/about-us/thijs-de-valk/\">Thijs</a>.

A bit more researching learned us that WordPress automatically adds a <code>noindex, nofollow</code> robots meta tag to each URL that has <code>?replytocom</code> in it. At first I (wrongly) thought this was new to WordPress 3.5, but it turns out to be the default behavior for quite a while already. All the more reason to tell you about it:</p>\n<h2>What are these <code>?replytocom</code> links?</h2>\n<p>Most blogs these days have threaded commenting enabled, which means that you can reply to every comment by clicking on that comments reply link. This is very neat to keep the conversations together and a feature I deeply love. This feature normally works with javascript, but because of accessibility, there is also a fallback option. If you don&#8217;t have javascript enabled, or, if you&#8217;re a bot, you&#8217;re not capable of handling it, you&#8217;ll see links that look as follows:</p>\n<pre>http://www.example.com/example-post/?replytocom=1</pre>\n<p>This would force reload the page and give you the option to reply to the comment with ID 1. I absolutely hate that fallback link. On a site like this one, with often over a hundred comments on a post, it means there are 100 links pointing to that same article, causing a lot of crawling that&#8217;s totally unneeded. For this reason I added the option in my SEO plugin to remove it, which you&#8217;ll find under SEO → Permalinks:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-61479\" alt=\"remove replytocom variables option in WordPress SEO\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/replytocom.jpg\" width=\"550\" height=\"72\" /></p>\n<h2>So what does this noindex,nofollow do?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the robots meta tag WordPress adds essentially makes every URL with<br />\n<code>?replytocom</code> in it a dead end street. Because of the <code>nofollow</code> bit of the robots meta tag it adds, if say, Mashable would link to a URL with <code>replytocom</code> in it, my site wouldn&#8217;t actually benefit from that link. Doing nothing is much better: the <code>rel=\"canonical\"</code> link element on the page, that points to the clean version, would tell search engines to use that clean version.</p>\n<p>This is the reason why, when I found out, I immediately released version 1.3.3 of my WordPress SEO plugin that removes that <code>noindex,nofollow</code> line.

As Bill Slawski pointed out in the comments, Paul has written articles on SEO <a href=\"http://boagworld.com/marketing/i-dont-get-seo/\">before</a>. Paul, whom I respect tremendously for his web development work, obviously doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; SEO and has evidently had some bad experiences with the snake oil side of our trade over the years. Luckily he&#8217;s shown himself to be willing to learn and I hope to be part of that learning experience. But I also wanted to write about this as I think it&#8217;s important for our industry.</p>\n<p>His main argument, after you remove the link-bait title and the weird introduction, is that what <em>we</em> SEO&#8217;s call SEO these days, shouldn&#8217;t be called SEO as it should be called (decent) web development. I agree in large part with that statement. But here&#8217;s the kicker: if a web developer or web development agency fails (and they do, very often, very miserably), the client often doesn&#8217;t notice. The web developer often delivers a shiny new website with all the bells and whistles that the management asked about. The fact that technically, information structurally and architecturally, the entire site is a mess, will not be noticed by 99% of clients. At least&#8230;</p>\n<p>Not until they notice their analytics, or rather, the fact that their phone stops ringing. And they notice one specific thing: a big hole in their traffic, where organic traffic from search engines used to be. That&#8217;s when they call an SEO, because those are the people that know about search engines, right? That, Paul, is why we&#8217;re still called SEO&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a demand driven thing: the client wants more search traffic, so he / she searches for someone that delivers that to them. They don&#8217;t know that their web developer did a lousy job, it&#8217;s <em>our</em> job to tell that to them.</p>\n<p>In our <a href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/\">website reviews</a> we encounter, on a daily basis, websites that have been redesigned where the web developer / designer deemed it &#8220;not necessary&#8221; to do 301 redirects from the old URL structure to the new one. Where development environments are left open for Google to index and a few wrong links in the content mistakenly go <em>to</em> that development environment, causing havoc for the website in question. Websites where a fancy new faceted based search system causes 4.5 <em>billion</em> URLs (actual example), to be created and Google slowly indexes all of them, leaving the websites ranking in dust. I can go on for hours.</p>\n<p>My buddy <a href=\"http://theuws.com\">Richard</a> commented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But what if they call it “inbound marketing”?</p></blockquote>\n<p>To which Paul said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I much prefer that. It does not apply that sites should be optimised for search engines over users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sigh. First of all, if SEO means anything, it&#8217;s that we optimize the search engine, not the site. The term is a weird acronym, but people know it now, so we stick with it. You see, even when BMW wants to sell &#8220;mobility&#8221;, in the end they sell cars. We all <em>want</em> to sell website optimization, but in the end, people come to us for SEO. That we&#8217;ll give them website optimization as a result doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>\n<p>Also in the comments, <a href=\"http://www.seobythesea.com/about-seo-by-the-sea/\">Bill Slawski</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A person who uses things like keyword density and gateway pages is not an SEO, and never has been.</p>\n<p>But, if you need help with hreflang, canonical link elements, parameter handling, rel prev and next values for pagination, XML sitemaps for pages and images and videos and news, Google Plus authorship markup, Facebook’s Open Graph meta data, schema.org implementation, and many other issues that great content alone will not solve, an SEO can help you with those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To his credit, Paul <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/11/seo-the-inconvenient-truth/#comment-985658\">responded</a> to that thanking Bill and stating that these:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; are not things I would expect any half decent web designers to do as part of their job.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well to be honest Paul, I do expect a decent web designer to know that stuff and if he doesn&#8217;t, I expect him, and thus you, to stop commenting about SEO until you <em>do</em> know about that stuff. You obviously don&#8217;t, because If I take your article from 2010, linked above, as an example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you haven&#8217;t implemented <a href=\"http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/\">rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</a>;</li>\n<li>I can&#8217;t find an XML sitemap;</li>\n<li>most of the pages on his site except for singular posts and pages lack a decent <a href=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">rel=&#8221;canonical&#8221; link element</a>;</li>\n<li>there is no <a href=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=&#8221;prev&#8221; / rel=&#8221;next&#8221;</a> implementation on his archives;</li>\n<li>in fact, there is no decent pagination on those archives at all, and lastly;</li>\n<li>there is no schema.org markup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I could go on. So, Paul, you say in your article that SEO should be decent web development, but you obviously haven&#8217;t kept up to date with what decent web development is then. I have an easy fix for you though. If you install my (100% free as in beer) <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> and take 2 minutes to configure it, 1 through 4 will be taken care of for you by that plugin, automatically. But if you do that I will take that as an acceptance that there is a very <em>convenient</em> truth about SEO. I trust I&#8217;ll get to convince you that SEO is worth while, but I think the world deserves more than just a comment on your post as a counter argument to your headline, which I know you now regret.</p>\n<p>Let this be the first step in me, and others, convincing you of the value in SEO. I very much hope to see an article from your hand in 6 to 12 months time stating you were wrong.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/seo-paul-boag/\">Want SEOs to lose their job?

It means I&#8217;ve asked <a href=\"http://sucuri.net/\">Sucuri</a> to do a full security review of my WordPress SEO plugin. They found a couple of small issues, which I&#8217;ve all addressed in the 1.3 release I put out earlier today.</p>\n<p>So while 1.3 might not be a major release in terms of functionality, it is the result of quite a bit of work. If you check <a href=\"http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/632010/wordpress-seo\">this commit</a>, you&#8217;ll see a <em>ton</em> of little changes have gone into the plugin. Most of them are really minor, but all combined, they make for a better and, more importantly, safer plugin.</p>\n<p>I plan to do more updates to my biggest plugins to fix things like this.

There&#8217;s one issue: the developers at Automattic seem to think they&#8217;re alone in the world. In their last release, they enabled OpenGraph tags by default with no setting to disable it. Even when you already have <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO</a> enabled and OpenGraph enabled in that. This is making people freak  out everywhere as double OpenGraph tags lead to problems with Google+ and with Facebook.</p>\n<h2>Disable OpenGraph in Jetpack</h2>\n<p>The best solution, honestly, is to install another plugin by Mark Jaquith, called <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/manual-control/\">Manual Control for Jetpack</a>. This disables Jetpack automatic activation of new modules. Now you at least have to manually <em>do </em>something for stuff to break on your site when the Jetpack team decides to push new stuff.</p>\n<p>This particular OpenGraph feature is in the Publicize module, so you&#8217;d think you could disable that, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to work. Instead, adding this line in your functions.php should fix <em>this</em> particular problem:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">add_filter( \'jetpack_enable_opengraph\', \'__return_false\', 99 );</pre>\n<p>I understand that disabling OpenGraph in WordPress SEO could work too. I would recommend against that though, especially if you use our <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/video-seo/\">Video SEO plugin</a> as that relies on our ability to control OpenGraph tags.</p>\n<h2>Calling for Automattic to be more responsible</h2>\n<p>I also want to call on <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a>&#8216;s Jetpack team. You guys should know better than to do stuff like this. You&#8217;ve literally cost me about half a days worth of support work now with this single release. It&#8217;d be cool if you, just like the rest of Automattic, would work <em>with</em> the community instead of against it.</p>\n<p>I know you&#8217;re capable of it, because this line in the plugin:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if ( in_array( \'facebook/facebook.php\', $active_plugins ) )\nadd_filter( \'jetpack_enable_opengraph\', \'__return_false\', 99 );</pre>\n<p>This shows me that you <em>did</em> think about what would happen if Facebook&#8217;s plugin was active. That&#8217;s logical because people at Automattic worked on that plugin too. Now next time, please look at some of the repositories most popular plugins too and adjust accordingly. At the very least start a conversation with plugin authors about what&#8217;s coming up when you create stuff that clashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: might be good to note, when Facebook&#8217;s plugin is active and OpenGraph is enabled in my SEO plugin, my plugin filters the output of the Facebook plugin to prevent two sets of OpenGraph tags. Niall Kennedy of Facebook has actually also submitted a patch to my SEO plugin to improve how it does OpenGraph. That&#8217;s how this community <em>should</em> work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/jetpack-and-wordpress-seo/\">Jetpack and WordPress SEO</a> is a post by <a rel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

It turned out not to be as simple as I wanted it to be, but I fixed it. This posts documents my mistakes and issues with my WordPress SSL setup in the hope of preventing you from making them.</p>\n<p>You might think: couldn&#8217;t I just always load that image over SSL? Yes you could, but that&#8217;d be slower, which is why I chose not to do it.</p>\n<h2>Getting an SSL certificate on your server</h2>\n<p>This is by far the geekiest bit of this entire process, and not something I want to explain completely. In fact, I didn&#8217;t even do this myself. Just like <em>all</em> other VPS.net customers, you can get a free Comodo SSL certificate, all you have to do is file a support request for your VPS. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I think VPS.net delivers the <a href=\"http://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-hosting/\">best WordPress hosting</a> out there. BTW, they&#8217;re running a special at VPS.net, giving away Amazon gift cards for new VPSes, so if you&#8217;ve been thinking about switching, now&#8217;s a better time than any to switch to <a href=\"http://yoast.com/out/vps/\">VPS.net</a>.</p>\n<p>I had already set up the free certificate a while back, as I wanted to run my <a href=\"#wordpress-admin-ssl\">WordPress admin over https</a>, but I decided to go for a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate\">Extended Validation certificate</a> today. This is a certificate that doesn&#8217;t just show an SSL icon in the browsers location bar but actually gives a green background for it and adds the company&#8217;s name, like so:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-56011\" title=\"extended validation SSL certificate\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/extended-validation-certificate.jpg\" alt=\"extended validation SSL certificate\" width=\"411\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p>Of course this isn&#8217;t needed for every site, but I think it&#8217;s worth testing if you sell products. It provides just that bit of extra trust that can be <em>so</em> needed for online transactions.</p>\n<h2>Next: forcing SSL on that one page</h2>\n<p>There are plugins that can do this for you, most notably <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-https/\">WordPress HTTPS</a>, but as I wanted a bit more control and understanding of what was happening, I decided to code it manually. The code consists of two bits, this bit forces the checkout page to be on https all the time and at the same time redirects all pages that do not need to be SSL to an http URL:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">function yst_ssl_template_redirect() {\n	if ( is_page( 123 ) &amp;&amp; ! is_ssl() ) {\n		if ( 0 === strpos($_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'], \'http\') ) {\n			wp_redirect(preg_replace(\'|^http://|\', \'https://\', $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\']), 301 );\n			exit();\n		} else {\n			wp_redirect(\'https://\' . $_SERVER[\'HTTP_HOST\'] . $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'], 301 );\n			exit();\n		}\n	} else if ( !is_page( 123 ) &amp;&amp; is_ssl() &amp;&amp; !is_admin() ) {\n		if ( 0 === strpos($_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'], \'http\') ) {\n			wp_redirect(preg_replace(\'|^https://|\', \'http://\', $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\']), 301 );\n			exit();\n		} else {\n			wp_redirect(\'http://\' . $_SERVER[\'HTTP_HOST\'] . $_SERVER[\'REQUEST_URI\'], 301 );\n			exit();\n		}\n	}\n}\nadd_action( \'template_redirect\', \'yst_ssl_template_redirect\', 1 );</pre>\n<p>If you&#8217;re sure the URL will always be &#8220;clean&#8221;, as in, without parameters, this can be even simpler, but in this case I needed it to work with the URL parameters that <a href=\"http://yoast.com/selling-wordpress-plugins/\">Easy Digital Downloads</a> uses. The number 123 is the ID of the checkout page, you should of course replace with your own page ID if you use this code.</p>\n<p>Now we also want get_permalink to return the right URL, so let&#8217;s filter its output:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">function yst_checkout_page_ssl( $permalink, $post, $leavename ) {\n	if ( 123 == $post-&gt;ID )\n		return preg_replace( \'|^http://|\', \'https://\', $permalink );\n	return $permalink;\n}\nadd_filter( \'pre_post_link\', \'yst_checkout_page_ssl\', 10, 3 );</pre>\n<p>This way if something links to the checkout page, the redirect isn&#8217;t even needed as the link is already an https link.</p>\n<h2>MaxCDN, W3 Total Cache &amp; SSL: a golden trio</h2>\n<p>My favourite <a href=\"http://yoast.com/articles/cdn-wordpress-maxcdn/\">WordPress CDN provider MaxCDN</a>, works great with W3 Total Cache. It does so even with SSL, <em>if</em> you know how to set it up. It&#8217;s very bloody simple too once you know it: for each CNAME, you enter not just the CNAME, but you follow it by a comma, and then enter the SSL version. For me, this looks like this (click for larger version):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/w3tc-maxcdn-ssl.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-55907\" title=\"WordPress SSL Setup: W3TC MacCDN SSL settings\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/w3tc-maxcdn-ssl-535x296.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress SSL Setup: W3TC MacCDN SSL settings\" width=\"535\" height=\"296\" /></a></p>\n<p>This settings makes W3 Total Cache use the first hostname for http requests, and the second one for https. With a rather image heavy site like this one that&#8217;s a golden thing.</p>\n<h2>Broken SSL: fixing links in theme files</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"broken SSL\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/broken-ssl.jpg\" alt=\"broken SSL\" width=\"90\" height=\"29\" />If you load a page over SSL, all the other files that are loaded on that page should <em>also</em> be loaded over SSL for it to not be &#8220;broken&#8221;. This means that every single image, javascript file, stylesheet etc. needs to be loaded over SSL. WordPress will fix a <em>lot</em> of this for you, but you&#8217;ll probably encounter some issues, as did I, causing a broken SSL icon in the location bar, as shown above here.</p>\n<p>In my case, within my theme&#8217;s stylesheet, I was loading a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webfonts\">google web font</a> file. That shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, of course, but I was loading that font file over http, instead of using what&#8217;s called a <strong>protocol relative link</strong>. Every time you&#8217;re embedding images, javascript or CSS files, you should be using a protocol relative link. Instead of linking to:</p>\n<p><code>http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,600</code></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m now linking to:</p>\n<p><code>//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:400,600</code></p>\n<p>As you can see, I left out the http:, this will make the browser use the current protocol to fetch that file. This means that when a user is on plain http, it&#8217;ll use that, which is faster, but if the user is on https, it&#8217;ll use the safe https link.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wordpress-admin-ssl\">Bonus: WordPress SSL setup for the admin panel</h2>\n<p>Now that you&#8217;ve set all this up, you might as well use that SSL certificate for your admin too. That part is actually pretty easy. Just drop this in the <em>wp-config.php</em>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">define(\'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN\', true);</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;ll force the entire admin over SSL, which is what you want in most cases. If that is too slow for you though, you could also decide to just force the login page over SSL:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">define(\'FORCE_SSL_LOGIN\', true);</pre>\n<p>This will force the login and registration pages to be SSL. I think you should go for the first option though, and run your entire admin over SSL.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: WordPress SSL setup is easy, do it!</h2>\n<p>With all these tips, there&#8217;s really no reason anymore why you couldn&#8217;t run <em>any</em> page where a user submits private data on SSL. So, just do it!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-ssl-setup/\">WordPress SSL setup tips &#038; tricks</a> is a post by <a rel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

This one brings support for yet another few plugins <em>and</em> some more: two new video hosting platforms: Wistia and Vippy.</p>\n<h2>Wistia support: embedding <em>and</em> SEO</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-55143\" title=\"Wistia logo\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/wistia-logo-e1352799587361.png\" alt=\"Wistia logo\" width=\"200\" height=\"54\" />The support for <a href=\"http://wistia.com\">Wistia</a> that is added in this release was on the list from day one of this plugins release. It was one of the most highly requested video platforms to be supported, but there was an issue: there&#8217;s no official Wistia plugin other than a small thing that preserves the embed code from being mangled, even though Wistia itself <em>does</em> support oEmbed.</p>\n<p>So I decided to go the extra mile and add oEmbed support for Wistia through the plugin, which, in itself is fairly easy. But then I found out that oEmbed in WordPress really has <em>no</em> way to filter the URL you&#8217;re sending to the video provider, and I needed to add variables to get the SEO version of the embed code. A lot of thinking later, I decided, heck, let&#8217;s try it with the normal embed code. And it worked, miraculously, Google found it and properly showed it as a video.</p>\n<p>WordPress 3.5 adds a filter for the oEmbed URL, which means that when you use a URL in the editor, I can add parameters to that to further optimize, so we&#8217;ll do that further down the line. For now, this update makes it easy to embed Wistia videos, just drop the URL to the video on one line and it should embed the video properly, recognize it in Video SEO and do all the optimization for you. Gotta love simplicity.</p>\n<h2>Vippy support</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-55149\" style=\"padding: 5px;\" title=\"Vippy logo\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/logo-vippy.png\" alt=\"Vippy logo\" width=\"116\" height=\"45\" />Another video platform that had been requested literally on day one of the plugin being released was <a href=\"http://vippy.co/\">Vippy</a>, requested by my SEOktoberfest buddy Geir. His colleague from <a href=\"http://www.metronet.no/\">Metronet</a>, well known WordPress developer Ronald Huereca, patched the plugin to automatically support Vippy when the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/vippy/\">Vippy WordPress plugin</a> is being used.</p>\n<h2>Supported plugins &amp; themes</h2>\n<p>This release adds support for two video embedding plugins, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/\">FlowPlayer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/wordpress-video-lightbox-plugin-display-videos-in-a-fancy-lightbox-overlay-2700\">WP Video Lightbox</a>. Which means we now support 12 video plugins. We now also support the embed codes for YouTube and Vimeo videos from the popular <a href=\"http://weavertheme.com/\">Weaver theme</a>, even though I think it&#8217;s unwise to use those, because when you switch themes, your videos will no longer play.</p>\n<h2>What else do you want?</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a user of the plugin: what else would you like to see?

A lot of people have asked me about the how and why of the selling and I thought it&#8217;d be a good idea to outline that in a post.</p>\n<h2>Why sell premium WordPress plugins?</h2>\n<p>Of course we got some backlash for making a plugin available to the world and <em>daring</em> to charge for it. Unfortunately there are still people in the WordPress community who think everything should be free. What they don&#8217;t understand is that not everything <em>can</em> be free.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m the author of several <em>highly</em> popular WordPress plugins. My <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/\">Google Analytics plugin</a> is nearing 4 million downloads and my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> has over 2.5 million downloads. They&#8217;re both free. I&#8217;m not saying making those free plugins hasn&#8217;t made me any money, of course it has. There are some (though few) <a href=\"http://yoast.com/donate/\">donations</a>, there are people ordering <a href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-us/website-review/\">website reviews</a>, hiring me as a consultant etc. But we&#8217;d make more money if we didn&#8217;t release those plugins. That&#8217;s the cold and harsh reality. I&#8217;m not willing to stop releasing those plugins though. I&#8217;ve always said they&#8217;ll be free and I want to keep those that I&#8217;ve released for free, free.</p>\n<p>Other plugins though, like the <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/video-seo/\">Video SEO plugin</a>, require a bit more support and continuous updating to work with video networks, new embed codes, changes from Google, etc. When I was looking at what needed to be done for that, I knew that releasing it for free was not going to be a viable option. Which is why we made it premium. Some people think its price tag $89 is too much. Well, in that case, you&#8217;re not seeing the value yet and I probably need to explain better. Anyone who knows what this kind of search traffic is worth to their site knows that $89 is dirt cheap.</p>\n<h3>Making money directly == more time to invest in development</h3>\n<p>Getting paid to develop a plugin means you can invest more time. I don&#8217;t have to make my money doing consulting on the side now, working on those plugins is paying for itself. This means development on these plugins accelerates quite a bit. I&#8217;ve been able to add support for a nice list of video embedding plugins to the Video SEO plugin because of that and the next version, due tomorrow, will add two new video hosting providers, <a href=\"http://wistia.com/\">Wistia</a> and <a href=\"http://vippy.co/\">Vippy</a>.</p>\n<p>I can honestly say that this has done very well for us. The plugin has made us a nice amount so far and users seem to be very happy. Reviews like <a href=\"http://www.stateofsearch.com/yoast-wordpress-video-seo/\">this one from Bas</a> and this tweet from Bryan make me very happy and proud:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p>1 week after implementing the Yoast Video SEO for WordPress + SEO plugin &amp; ranking high with video thumbnails for important phrases! Use it!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Bryan Eisenberg (@TheGrok) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheGrok/status/265449264719740928\" data-datetime=\"2012-11-05T13:43:31+00:00\">November 5, 2012</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>You now know the why, on to the how:</p>\n<h2>How we sell premium WordPress plugins</h2>\n<p>When I decided I wanted to go premium, I needed an infrastructure to sell those plugins. I looked at ThemeForest / CodeCanyon and several other marketplaces. All of them wanted an extraordinary percentage of sales, considering how much extra sales I estimated they would add. Of course I do have a head start, being in this industry for a while and having been blogging on this blog for at least 7 consecutive years.</p>\n<p>So, I decided to go self hosted. I tried several ecommerce plugins and while each had their benefits, they all failed to do well what I needed them to do best: deliver digital goods. All of them failed, until I found <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com?ref=115\">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>\n<p>This plugin was built with the exact purpose of what I needed to do in mind, and built by a coder who actually knows how to write decent code, Pippin Williamson. He has a good model around it too, the core plugin is free and can be found on WordPress.org, while he has a <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extensions/?ref=115\">growing set of extensions</a> of which some are premium.</p>\n<p>The first ones you&#8217;ll want to grab are for payment gateways. I&#8217;m not in the US, so I can&#8217;t use Stripe, unfortunately, which left me with PayPal (which is built-in and free) and Moneybookers. It&#8217;s not ideal, so I&#8217;m trying to figure out a better solution, if you have ideas, do let me know in the comments.</p>\n<p>I use another one of these premium extensions, the <a title=\"Software licensing extension for Easy Digital Downloads\" href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/software-licensing/?ref=115\">software licensing</a> one, to generate my license keys and several others to perform various other tasks and tricks, like a MailChimp extension to sign people up to my mailing list when they buy, an AWS S3 extension to host my files on Amazon, etc. etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/google-analytics-ecommerce-tracking/?ref=115\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-54983\" title=\"Google Analytics eCommerce tracking for Easy Digital Downloads\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ga-edd-logo.png\" alt=\"Google Analytics eCommerce tracking for Easy Digital Downloads\" width=\"263\" height=\"164\" /></a>In fact, I even wrote my own, an extension to track sales in Google Analytics ecommerce tracking, which is now <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/extension/google-analytics-ecommerce-tracking/?ref=115\">for sale for $15 on the EDD site</a>. It has allowed me to optimize my sales process already, and if you start selling, I hope it&#8217;ll help you too. The fact that it was relatively easy to write this extension is a testament to how well written Easy Digital Downloads is.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: use Easy Digital Downloads &amp; sell!</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever considered selling plugins or ebooks or other digital goods, this is the plugin you need <em>and</em> it&#8217;s written by the kind of guy you want to rely on. Pippin has been tremendously good in support and has given some very smart advice.</p>\n<p>Also, I can definitely recommend selling plugins. It&#8217;s funny and a bit sad at the same time, but I realized the other day that while I get abusive, support demanding emails for my free plugins on a <em>daily</em> basis, each and every paid user that needed support has been great to work with. It&#8217;s as though when people pay for stuff, they respect that you have a job to do, whereas some free plugin users seem to not think about <em>you</em> at all.

While it&#8217;s a pretty rare phenomenon I thought it was a good idea to share with the wider community and see what one can do about it.</p>\n<p>After installing my video SEO plugin there are a few things that can happen, usually after having waited for about a week / two weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It works, and the video thumbnails start showing as universal search results (most common).</li>\n<li>It works in universal search results for some, but not for all of the videos, but all of the videos can be found on the videos tab in the search results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s really only the two options I&#8217;m encountering now, I&#8217;ve yet to see a site where my plugin works (as in, it detects the videos and generates a good XML video sitemap etc) and Google doesn&#8217;t show the video in the search results at all, so that&#8217;s encouraging. I have been wondering and researching the second option though. What is the difference between posts that Google shows a video snippet for, and posts that it doesn&#8217;t give that treatment?</p>\n<h2>Video SEO research: why it doesn&#8217;t work sometimes</h2>\n<p>The pages where I found Google wasn&#8217;t showing a video snippet all shared one trait: they were all heavy content pages. Which is why I started thinking about those and what could be the cause of Google not showing a video result but a normal text result.</p>\n<p>Then it hit me: what all of the posts that have videos, but aren&#8217;t getting a video snippet in the search results <em>actually</em> have in common, is that <strong>the video is not the primary content of the page</strong>. The video is &#8220;added on&#8221; as a bonus, of sorts, instead of being the primary piece. It makes sense for Google to not want to show a video snippet when what the user gets is actually textual or image content, with the video being only a tiny portion of the page.</p>\n<h2>Your videos back in the search results: the solution</h2>\n<p>The solution is, as you might have guessed, rather simple. It&#8217;s a hard balance to get though: Google still doesn&#8217;t understand the video itself, so it needs <em>some</em> content around the video to understand what the video is about. Give it 2-300 words, meaningful tags and a good title and you&#8217;ll be a long way there. In theory, if the content is just the transcript of the video, it shouldn&#8217;t hurt you, but I haven&#8217;t tested that yet.</p>\n<p>Now if I had a long piece of content and a video, I would create not one, but two posts. While doing that you have to make a judgement call: if you think your site is strong enough to rank with two results in the top 10 for a given query, target the same keyword. You might get a text result <em>and</em> a video result in the same search results page.</p>\n<p>If your site isn&#8217;t strong enough to rank with even a text result, optimize the video post for your target keyword and link from the content post to the video result. You might be able to boost your own video result into the search results, as ranking with a video tends to be easier than ranking with a text result.</p>\n<h2>General tip: be sure to use the word video!</h2>\n<p>Related to all of the above is one very simple tip: make sure to add the word video to titles of posts that contain a video, and to mention the word video a couple of times. People are actively searching for video content quite often, make sure they can find yours!</p>\n<p>That last tip and the fact that you shouldn&#8217;t have <em>too</em> much content actually got me thinking: my page analysis functionality in my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a>, which is needed for my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/video-seo/\">Video SEO plugin</a>, is actually giving you slightly the wrong hints in that regard, as it urges you to write longer copy, when a bit shorter copy would actually be beneficial. So I decided to fix that. If you have the latest version of both plugins, the page analysis functionality will now give you hints about the length of your copy <em>and</em> it will hint you to use the word video in your title.</p>\n<p>This means you might get a notice like this (click for larger version):</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/video-warning.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-52825\" title=\"Video SEO notices\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/video-warning-535x38.png\" alt=\"Video SEO notices\" width=\"535\" height=\"38\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you have any other ideas of checks I could add to make it easier for you to optimize your videos, do let me know in the comments!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/video-not-showing-search-results/\">Video not showing in search results: why?</a> is a post by <a rel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Keep on reading for a bit of backstory.</p>\n<p>Video SEO is probably one of the most technically challenging aspects of SEO. There are several ways to make it known to Google that a certain page contains a video, ranging from Facebook share markup, Schema.org videoObject markup, MediaRSS enhancements to feeds to XML Video sitemaps. This plugin supports all four of those methods.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of work to get all this working seamlessly, but I think I&#8217;ve nailed it all. I wanted to make it as simple as putting a video in a post and then having the plugin do <em>all</em> the needed work. I succeeded. If you now use oEmbed to embed a video from say, Vimeo, into your blog, just by copy/pasting the URL onto a single line in your editor, and hit update, you&#8217;ll see that the Video SEO plugin grabs all the needed metadata from the Vimeo API and does all the legwork needed to make your video&#8217;s rank.</p>\n<p>How you&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s recognized the video? Because it will update the snippet into a video snippet:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Video Snippet Preview\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/video-snippet-590x156.png\" alt=\"Video Snippet Preview\" width=\"590\" height=\"156\" /></p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t just do that for Vimeo video&#8217;s, it works with a lot of platforms, including YouTube. How it does the YouTube thing is a question some of the more experienced SEO&#8217;s will ask. I leave that as an exercise to the reader. Check my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/video-sitemap.xml\">video-sitemap.xml</a> and see if you can find it. Whether that&#8217;ll keep working? I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>Of course the video SEO plugin is based on and uses large parts of my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a>, and therefor needs that to run. This will really allow you to take any site with video to the next level though. I&#8217;m very proud of it and hope that those of you running video sites will see the benefits and buy it.</p>\n<p>Now I know some people will start to complain that it&#8217;s a paid plugin. I can even understand that to a certain extent. Please just realize that it&#8217;s impossible to build a plugin like this and support it, without being paid for those efforts. It takes a <em>lot</em> of work, almost 1.5 years of thinking and learning has gone into making this plugin as good as it is, and it&#8217;ll probably require very regular updates to keep in line with all the supported video platforms. To be able to do that, I have to charge for the plugin. It&#8217;s called a business model. Be glad that I found one, as it will also support the continued development of the core SEO plugin.</p>\n<p>I hope, and fully expect it to work out well for everyone involved. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts and, I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;d love even more to see you <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/video-seo/\">buy the plugin</a>!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/video-seo-release/\">Video SEO just became a lot easier!</a> is a post by <a rel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

If you do not use them yet, you most definitely should. I’m using custom dashboards to measure SEO, PPC, ROI, conversions and more. I also made a custom dashboard for WordPress blogs using Yoast’s <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/google-analytics/\">Google Analytics for WordPress plugin</a>. I already shared it in Dutch on <a href=\"http://www.jeroenvaneck.com/\">my own blog</a>, but Joost asked me to share it with his readers as well. So here it is.</p>\n<h2>About the dashboard</h2>\n<p>This dashboard is meant to give a quick insight into all the important things you want to know about your blog at any given time. First of all I’d like to explain some metrics I’ve chosen to use in this dashboard. Firstly I chose to use visits instead of visitors because you also want to know when someone visits your blog multiple times. Secondly I chose to use unique page views instead of page views because I want to know how many people read my posts, not how many times they are read. Thirdly with this dashboard I tried to create insights into metrics about posts instead of metrics about all pages.</p>\n<h2>How to build this dashboard</h2>\n<p>First of all this dashboard of course contains a section regarding the most important core metrics. In this case I chose to include widgets containing the number of visits, the number of new visitors, a graph of the number of visits over the chosen period, the pages per visit and the average time on site. So far: nothing special. These widgets you can create without filtering any data.</p>\n<h2>Google Analytics for WordPress</h2>\n<p>For the following sections you need to use the Google Analytics for WordPress plugin. The plugin will allow you to use custom variables to track post types, authors, categories and tags. In the settings of the plugin you can activate them in Custom Variable Settings (in advanced settings). These settings allow you to show the interesting data for your dashboard. Depending on which Custom Variables you use you have to tweak your dashboard. For this dashboard we’ve used the following settings:</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/custom-variable-settings-yoast.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-45997\" title=\"Custom Variable Settings Yoast\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/custom-variable-settings-yoast-536x389.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Variable Settings Yoast\" width=\"536\" height=\"389\" /></a></p>\n<p>When you use different settings you have to check which variable is saved in which custom variable key.<br />\nWith these settings you are able to count the number of posts read on your blog and the most read posts. Because the plugin creates a custom variable containing the post type for each post that has been viewed you only need to filter the pages containing any kind of post type.</p>\n<p>The widget settings for the number of posts read will look like this:</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/number-of-posts-read.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-46001\" title=\"Number of posts read\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/number-of-posts-read-536x283.jpg\" alt=\"Number of posts read\" width=\"536\" height=\"283\" /></a></p>\n<p>The widget settings for the most read posts will look like this:</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/most-read-posts.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-46000\" title=\"Most read posts\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/most-read-posts-536x309.jpg\" alt=\"Most read posts\" width=\"536\" height=\"309\" /></a></p>\n<p>The other custom variables created by the plugin allow you to show a few other interesting numbers. In this example we’ve chosen to show the most read authors and most read categories, but you could also show the most read tags or the number of posts by publication year.</p>\n<p>The widget settings for the most read authors will look like this:</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/most-read-authors.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-45998\" title=\"Most read authors\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/most-read-authors-536x288.jpg\" alt=\"Most read authors\" width=\"536\" height=\"288\" /></a></p>\n<p>The widget settings for the most read categories will look like this:</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/most-read-categories.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-45999\" title=\"Most read categories\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/most-read-categories-536x288.jpg\" alt=\"Most read categories\" width=\"536\" height=\"288\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n<p>Lastly the dashboard contains an overview of the most important traffic sources split up in used medium, social sources and used organic search terms.</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>I recommend you try to build this dashboard on your own. Not only to understand how it works but also to be able to choose to represent data in a different way. But of course I will provide you with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/analytics/web/permalink?uid=aoWyebltTe6p_02PrR16og\">a link</a> to the dashboard configuration, which you can save to the desired profile in your Google Analytics account. Remember you need to have the Google Analytics for WordPress plugin installed as mentioned to be able to see all the correct data. Otherwise you still have to tweak the dashboard yourself.</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy your dashboard. Do you have any questions or suggestions?

I&#8217;ve worked closely with Matt Cohen, WooThemes CTO, to build an import functionality for WooThemes users straight into WordPress SEO.</p>\n<p>I recently added statistics tracking to my two main plugins, and about 125,000 of you have already kindly agreed to send me some anonymous data. Because of that, I now know that <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2012/06/canvas/\">WooThemes Canvas</a> is actually one of the 10 most used themes <em>and</em> is used as a parent theme quite often as well, and their dozens of other themes are very, very popular, so this could mean a lot of new users for my SEO plugin. I welcome you all!</p>\n<h2>WooSEO Import</h2>\n<p>The WooSEO import functionality is very simple, activate the WordPress SEO plugin, go to SEO -&gt; Import and you&#8217;ll see this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-46022\" title=\"WooThemes Import at work: check the import from Woothemes box, press import\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/woothemes-import.png\" alt=\"WooThemes Import at work: check the import from Woothemes box, press import\" width=\"527\" height=\"281\" /></p>\n<p>You can check if the data has imported ok by opening up some posts and seeing if your WordPress SEO box contains the titles and meta descriptions you had entered in WooSEO. If it has imported ok, repeat the process above but check the &#8220;Delete the old data&#8221; checkbox, this will make sure your database is as clean as can be by deleting the old WooSEO values from the database.</p>\n<h2>Thank you to WooThemes!</h2>\n<p>By doing this, WooThemes is finally doing what I&#8217;ve been proposing theme companies do <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-theme/\">for ages now</a>: stop trying to provide an SEO framework and focus on good code, great design and the functionality to change that design. That&#8217;s a step I thank &amp; applaud them for and I fully hope other theme vendors will do the same.

That&#8217;s super awesome news as it means that the implementation I did in my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> works.</p>\n<p>Of course I had to do some tweaking afterwards, because as it turns out Twitter&#8217;s scraper for the Twitter Card data is easily confused (it doesn&#8217;t understand how to parse multiple og:images meta tags). But let me show you what it means if it works well; if you tweet an article from this site, you&#8217;ll see a normal tweet with a new &#8220;View Summary&#8221; link:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45983\" title=\"Tweet with summary button\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tweet-summary-button.png\" alt=\"Tweet with summary button\" width=\"513\" height=\"88\" /></p>\n<p>When you click that View summary link, the link &#8220;expands&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see this, the complete Twitter Card:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45982\" title=\"Expanded Twitter Card\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/twitter-expanded-twitter-card.png\" alt=\"Expanded Twitter Card\" width=\"513\" height=\"314\" /></p>\n<p>As you might notice my Twitter account is there twice, the top one is because I&#8217;m the author of that article, the second one is because I set the @yoast account as the main account for this site. So if you see an article tweeted that&#8217;s been written by Michiel, you&#8217;ll see his twitter account on top and the main @yoast account in the bottom:</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-45984 alignnone\" title=\"Twitter Card Michiel\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/twitter-card-michiel.png\" alt=\"Twitter Card Michiel\" width=\"448\" height=\"187\" /></p>\n<h2>Can I have Twitter Cards for my site?</h2>\n<p>I know you&#8217;re asking yourself that question. I tested some sites that are running my SEO plugin on which I knew the Twitter Cards implementation in it is activated, but unfortunately couldn&#8217;t find any working examples outside of my own site yet. It seems that you really have to <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/form/participate-twitter-cards\">apply to participate</a> with your site next to having the functionality active on your site (you can activate it on the SEO -&gt; Social menu).</p>\n<p>So, the next step is another update of my SEO plugin which improves a bit on the current Twitter Card implementation now that I can test properly, expect that somewhere early next week. This update will also rely on OpenGraph when activated too where possible so you don&#8217;t have another 10 lines of Twitter meta data but instead only 3 or 4 lines for Twitter and the rest of the data coming from OpenGraph. Looking forward to seeing this work on other sites that run my SEO plugin!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/twitter-cards-in-action/\">Twitter Cards in action</a> is a post by <a rel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Whether they are taxonomy or category archives, like this <a href=\"http://yoast.com/cat/seo/\">SEO category</a>, Custom Post Type archives like this one for our <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-plugin-review/\">WordPress plugin reviews</a> or my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/speaking/\">speaking engagements</a>, or even date archives: they all share the same common traits. In WordPress an archive will, by default, consist only of a listing of posts. As these pages will get visited by normal people, that means those visitors are &#8220;thrown&#8221; upon a page that doesn&#8217;t try to tell them where they are.</p>\n<p>This lack of introduction gives visitors only two options: leave immediately because they don&#8217;t understand where they&#8217;ve ended up, or click through to an article, without you having had <em>any</em> chance of pushing them in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Because of that, every decent archive needs an &#8220;introduction&#8221;. This can be as simple as just a header that stands out, but for more important sections of your site, it actually pays of to write a bit of content.</p>\n<p>Before you write that content though, you first have to make sure that the content you write actually displays on those archive pages.</p>\n<h2>Show introductory content on archive pages</h2>\n<h3>Categories, Tags and Custom Taxonomies</h3>\n<p>For category, tag or custom taxonomy archives, you can simply create a custom template by creating a file. For categories, for instance, this file would be called category.php. If you don&#8217;t know how template hierarchy works within WordPress, check out <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-theme-anatomy/\">our infographic</a> on the topic.</p>\n<p>In this template, above the standard WordPress loop, you add the following code:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;!--?php if ( !get_query_var( \'paged\' ) ) { ?--&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n  &lt;!--?php echo wpautop( term_description() ); ?--&gt;\n&lt;!--?php } ?--&gt;</pre>\n<p>This uses the title you set for the category / tag / custom taxonomy, as well as the description, which you can fill in the WordPress backend.</p>\n<p>If you uses <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wp-theme/genesis/\">Genesis</a>, you don&#8217;t need to create an extra file, you can probably just check the box in your Genesis theme settings:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Genesis Archive Settings\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/genesis-archive-settings.png\" alt=\"Genesis Archive Settings\" width=\"575\" height=\"99\" /></p>\n<p>Or if that doesn&#8217;t work, you can just add this to your child theme&#8217;s functions.php (there&#8217;s still no need to make that file):</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;!--?php &lt;br ?--&gt;function yoast_term_archive_intro() {\n  if ( !is_category() &amp;&amp; !is_tag() &amp;&amp; !is_tax() )\n    return;\n\n  if( get_query_var( \'paged\' ) )\n    return;\n\n  echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1 class=&quot;entry-title&quot;&gt;\'.single_term_title(\'\', false).\'&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n  echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;\'.wpautop( term_description() ).\'&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n}\nadd_action( \'genesis_before_loop\', \'yoast_term_archive_intro\', 20 );</pre>\n<p>Of course you can add some extra code or classes in there to style those boxes a bit more.</p>\n<h3>Custom Post Type archives</h3>\n<p>For custom post type archives, this might actually be a bit harder. The beginning of the process is the same: you can create a new file, the name of which should contain your post type: <em>archive-{posttype}.php</em>.</p>\n<p>Then you could output the name of the post type using the following code:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if ( !get_query_var( \'paged\' ) ) {\n$pt = get_post_type_object( get_post_type() );\necho \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;\'.$pt-&gt;labels-&gt;name.\'&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n}</pre>\n<p>This is where the tricky bit comes in though: there is no backend in WordPress to input descriptions for these types of pages, nor is there a preferred way of storing that data. I added input fields for these to my Genesis child theme settings, which is too much to explain here, of course you could also hardcode it but that&#8217;s a bit ugly&#8230;</p>\n<p>Within Genesis, with the data coming from my child theme settings, I output the text using the following code in my functions.php (again, no reason to create a new file):</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;!--?php &lt;br ?--&gt;function yoast_cpt_intro() {\n  if ( !is_post_type_archive() )\n    return;\n\n  if( get_query_var( \'paged\' ) )\n    return;\n\n  $pt = get_post_type();\n  if ( genesis_get_option( $pt.\'-title\', \'child-settings\' ) ) {\n    echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;\'.genesis_get_option( $pt.\'-title\', \'child-settings\' ).\'&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n    echo wpautop( genesis_get_option( $pt.\'-intro\', \'child-settings\' ) );\n  }\n}\nadd_action( \'genesis_before_loop\', \'yoast_cpt_intro\', 20 );</pre>\n<h2>Prevent duplicate content</h2>\n<p>To avoid <a href=\"http://yoast.com/articles/duplicate-content/\">duplicate content</a>, we only add the introduction to the first page of an archive, if that archive is a paginated one. With the introduction of <a href=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=&#8221;next&#8221; and rel=&#8221;previous&#8221;</a>, sites that have implemented this well will be getting more visitors to the first page of a paginated series of archives anyway, but we still don&#8217;t want to show the same content on multiple pages.</p>\n<p>You might have noticed this line of code in the Genesis examples above:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if( get_query_var( \'paged\' ) )\nreturn;</pre>\n<p>This does exactly that: prevent the duplicate content.</p>\n<h2>Styling the archive introduction text</h2>\n<p>You should make sure that your introductory text for your archive really stands out. Remember, it&#8217;s not &#8220;just&#8221; there for SEO reasons, it&#8217;s there because people will read it! It&#8217;s very tempting to make it look just like another post, but you should take a bit more time and style it properly.</p>\n<p>I personally like the way we&#8217;ve done that in our recent redesign, this is for instance what the <a href=\"http://yoast.com/cat/wordpress/\">WordPress category</a> intro looks like:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45947\" title=\"WordPress category introduction\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wordpress-category-introduction.png\" alt=\"WordPress category introduction\" width=\"560\" height=\"187\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, the text for that introduction is a bit poor. I should probably do a much better job myself of explaining people where to go for what kinds of content, so I&#8217;ll get right on that once I finish this post&#8230; Which brings me to the last bit:</p>\n<h2>HTML in category descriptions</h2>\n<p>HTML in descriptions for categories, tags and custom taxonomies is currently disallow by default. I think that&#8217;s changing in an upcoming release, but for now you&#8217;ll have to fix that. If you&#8217;re using my WordPress SEO plugin, this has already been fixed for you, if not, AppThemes has quite a <a href=\"http://docs.appthemes.com/tutorials/allow-html-in-taxonomy-descriptions/\">good tutorial</a> on it.</p>\n<p>Let me know what you did with your archive pages in the comments, I&#8217;m very curious to see good examples!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-archive-pages/\">WordPress Archive Pages: the tutorial</a> is a post by <a rel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

It&#8217;s one of the services we expect to be there when we Google ourselves or other people. So when you Google yourself and instead of twitter.com, you see a weird result, you think &#8220;huh&#8221;. Then, when you&#8217;re like me, you try to figure out what caused that and once you figure it, you think &#8220;d0h!&#8221;. You&#8217;d think the people at Twitter would know better than to use relative URLs or even worse, a HOST header to determine the domain, resulting in this result when you search for my name:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45910\" title=\"yoast - twitter\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/yoast-twitter.png\" alt=\"yoast - twitter\" width=\"522\" height=\"83\" /></p>\n<p>Relative URLs stink. They really do. All sorts of SEO problems on the web are caused by the use of relative URLs in links, canonicals and more. We find issues with them in our <a href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">website reviews</a> on a regular basis, but as you can see bigger sites like Twitter also have massive issues because of them. I&#8217;ll try to explain why you shouldn&#8217;t use them and what you could do instead, as it might be simple things like this that hold you back from performing well with your website.</p>\n<h2>What are relative URLs?</h2>\n<p>Relative URLs are all URLs that do not contain a fully qualified domain name and path, but instead just the path or a portion of the path. So when your website is example.com, you could be linking to your contact page from your homepage like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;a href=&quot;contact.html&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>And back to your homepage from your contact page like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>The / refers to the directory / on the domain. So even when you&#8217;re three levels deep in a directory structure, linking to / would link to the frontpage. Lastly, when you&#8217;re on the corporate page of your about section, for instance <em>example.com/about/corporate.html</em>, you could link to your contact page like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;a href=&quot;../contact.html&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>All the resulting URLs are calculated by your browser based on the base URL. By default, this is the current URL that&#8217;s in your location bar, but using the <code>base</code> element, you could set it to something else, like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;base href=&quot;http://www.example.com/subdirectory/&quot;&gt;</pre>\n<p>Doing this would make the second link above, the link to /, resolve to <em>http://www.example.com/subdirectory/</em>.</p>\n<p>This was all fine when HTML was invented and websites consisted of real static HTML pages in directory structures. Now though, most of the web is built with content management systems, changing URLs is easier and some URLs might behave differently than what you&#8217;d expect. Because of that, relative URLs can cause a few different types of issues, all of which can be pretty detrimental for your SEO and your server performance.</p>\n<h3>Why are relative URLs still being used?</h3>\n<p>Relative URLs are often used because developers have a test environment on another hostname and it makes it easy for them to move stuff between their test environment and their live environment. Other reasons include that it&#8217;s &#8220;just easier in website maintenance&#8221;. They&#8217;re also, in my opinion falsely, <a href=\"http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/relative/\">promoted</a> by some websites about site speed because they&#8217;re &#8220;shorter&#8221; and thus &#8220;faster&#8221;.</p>\n<p>In reality, all of these reasons are false when you look at the bigger picture. The few minutes a developer might save by using relative URLs are offset by countless hours an SEO might be spending to solve the issues caused.</p>\n<h2>Some of the problems caused by relative URLs</h2>\n<p>Issues caused by the use of relative URLs are vast and plentiful, and any seasoned SEO can probably give you a few examples of clients that have had huge losses because of them. Let me show you a couple of them:</p>\n<h3>A completely indexed test environment</h3>\n<p>When you have a menu structure that relies on relative URLs, one wrong link in your content to your test environment would cause the entire test environment to be spidered and indexed, causing massive <a href=\"http://yoast.com/articles/duplicate-content/\">duplicate content issues</a>. This happens more often than you think, in fact, have you checked whether the test environment you used to test your last few development projects are indexed by Google? I bet some of you will now find out that they are indexed.</p>\n<h3>Spider traps</h3>\n<p>Most of the times I&#8217;ve found what we call &#8220;spider traps&#8221; they&#8217;re caused by wrongly used relative URLs. Let me show you an example: a site linking to ./example instead of ../example/, from the /contact/ page. A link to ./ means you&#8217;re linking to the current directory. When the current URL ends in /contact/ this means that a link to ./example/ resolves to /contact/example/. So clicking that link would take me to http://www.example.com/contact/example/, if your CMS is set up to serve the same page for /contact/example/ as it serves for /contact/, which is a <em>very</em> common case, you&#8217;ll now have a spider trap. Because that /content/example/ page also links to ./example/, which now resolves to /contact/example/example/, which then links to ./example/ again and thus links to /contact/example/example/example/ etc. etc. etc. You probably get the issue, and I hope you also understand why this could be <em>very</em> detrimental for your search engine rankings.</p>\n<p>These kinds of issues are <em>very</em> easily found using a tool like <a href=\"http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/\">Screaming Frog</a>, which I think every webmaster should have in its arsenal.</p>\n<h3>Relative canonical URLs</h3>\n<p>Issues can also be caused by using relative canonical URLs. A <a href=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">canonical URL</a> is supposed to link to the &#8220;perfect&#8221; URL for a piece of content on your website. If you use a relative link and also have a subdomain or test environment that&#8217;s indexed, you suddenly have several versions of a piece of content that all proclaim themselves as the canonical version of that piece of content&#8230; You can understand a search engine having a hard time dealing with this.</p>\n<h4>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing&#8230;</h4>\n<p>At Twitter, they figured out that they shouldn&#8217;t use relative canonicals. So a developer there thought he was smart and probably defined the domain part of the canonical URL using the HOST header information. This causes the very issue that I talked about in the introduction above, because now the IP result in the screenshot above has a canonical URL pointing to itself, causing Google to show Twitter&#8217;s IP&#8217;s in search results everywhere instead of the proper domain&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Protocol-relative URLs</h3>\n<p>Another issue is the so-called protocol relative URL. This is a URL that leaves of the http:// or https:// bit. This type of relative URL does have its uses, but it should not be deployed outside of those useful cases. The useful cases are when it&#8217;s used inside JavaScript or CSS, so files are served over the same protocol as the current page, especially because when you&#8217;re on a https URL, serving anything over http basically breaks the security. Using protocol relative URLs within links or canonical URLs is a <em>very bad idea</em> though, because you can still have duplicate content issues between http and https versions of a website.</p>\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n<p>WordPress core has this solution solved in a very nice way, using a couple of solutions:</p>\n<h3>Absolute URLs everywhere</h3>\n<p>Whenever WordPress outputs a URL, it&#8217;s always a full, absolute URL. For the domain name part of that it uses the domain you set in the General settings. This is the type of solution everyone should use: the domain name should be in a configuration file, this would allow you to still easily migrate between development environment and live environment by just using different configuration files.</p>\n<h3>Canonical Redirects</h3>\n<p>Whenever WordPress detects that you are on a specific article but are not using the proper &#8220;canonical&#8221; URL, it&#8217;ll try to 301 redirect you to the correct version. For the cases when it doesn&#8217;t detect this (it for instance ignores query parameters added to the URL), there is:</p>\n<h3>The canonical link URL element</h3>\n<p>When you&#8217;re on a single post or page, WordPress puts out a <a href=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">canonical link element</a>, based on what the URL of the current article should be, irregardless of what&#8217;s in your browsers location bar. My <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> extends this functionality to display canonical link elements just about everywhere within WordPress, and you should do this in your CMS too.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Twitter&#8217;s issue could be rather easily resolved, as we&#8217;ve discussed, by using proper absolute URLs everywhere in their code. There are no real good arguments against not doing that. While Twitter is not a direct e-commerce site and might not have the biggest of issues with losing a bit of traffic, I&#8217;ve had issues with relative URLs and relative canonicals at clients that have cost those clients upwards of a hundred thousand euro&#8217;s. The very small gain in web development time, if any, is never, ever, worth that.</p>\n<p>So you should be using absolute URLs at all times, canonical redirects when possible and canonical link elements should ideally be on every page you serve out. After all, when you&#8217;re building a brand, do you really want to lose that brand in the search result pages? I think that&#8217;s a waste and I&#8217;m guessing you do too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://yoast.com/relative-urls-issues/\">Why relative URLs should be forbidden for web developers</a> is a post by <a rel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a href=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>. \n\nA good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

This is undesirable as it means you&#8217;re not using tags to relate your posts together, which is what you should do. We usually tell them to optimize their tags but that&#8217;s easier to say than do. Deleting them is easy, but that&#8217;s not a solution. What you <em>should</em> be doing is merging multiple tags into one, adding more posts to a tag or delete &amp; redirect them to your homepage.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not something you want to do manually, as it&#8217;s a lot of work. That&#8217;s why I built a tool called the Term Optimizer. This tool helps you find tags or other taxonomy terms that are used only once, or even less, and allows you to merge them, redirect them, etc.</p>\n<h2>Optimize your WordPress Tags with the Term Optimizer</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s simple, once you&#8217;ve bought the file, you place it in your WordPress root directory, it needs to have <em>wp- load.php</em> in the same directory. You then open the URL and you&#8217;ll be seeing an interface like this (click for larger version):</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Term-Optimizer-by-Yoast.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-45853\" title=\"Easy Tag Optimization with Term Optimizer by Yoast\" alt=\"Easy Tag Optimization with Term Optimizer by Yoast\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Term-Optimizer-by-Yoast-590x533.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"523\" /></a></p>\n<p>By default it&#8217;ll search for all tags that are used less than 4 times. As you can see, there&#8217;s a checkbox before each post. If you check them and use the drop down in the top, you can choose from several actions:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45855\" title=\"With selected tags, do the following: merge, delete &amp; redirect, shows posts with term, search &amp; tag\" alt=\"With selected tags, do the following: merge, delete &amp; redirect, shows posts with term, search &amp; tag\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/with-selected-do.png\" width=\"372\" height=\"133\" /></p>\n<p>If you choose merge and selected, you&#8217;ll be presented with a second screen that allows you to choose the tag you want to merge these tags with. Once that&#8217;s done, if your .htaccess file is writeable, the tool will automatically add the redirect lines to your .htaccess file.</p>\n<p>Pressing delete will do something similar, you&#8217;ll be able to redirect to the homepage, to a category or to a custom URL:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45849\" title=\"Delete &amp; redirect tag\" alt=\"Delete &amp; redirect tag\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/delete-redirect-tag.png\" width=\"312\" height=\"199\" /></p>\n<p>This allows you to optimize your tags with only a few minutes / hours work, instead of having to get a developer to do all this work for you.</p>\n<h2>Quickly Adding Tags to Posts</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you realize that you should have created a certain tag and it&#8217;s now a lot of work to do that through the interface. With the term optimizer you can do that quite simply (click for larger image):</p>\n<p><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/search-tag.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-45860\" title=\"Search &amp; Tag posts\" alt=\"Search &amp; Tag posts\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/search-tag-590x632.png\" width=\"580\" height=\"621\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Buy this Tool, start Optimizing your Tags Now!</h2>\n<p>Do you want to clean up your tags or other terms?

It allows site owners to enhance the expanded tweets Twitter creates for their site, much in the same was as  OpenGraph tags give site owners the chance to determine what their posts &amp; pages will look like when shared on Facebook. In fact, Twitter chose to fall back to OpenGraph data when their specific tags aren&#8217;t being used, just as Google+ does.</p>\n<p>A while back Alex posted about <a href=\"http://yoast.com/facebook-open-graph-protocol/\">OpenGraph</a> here and users of my <a href=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> will have noticed that quite some development went into (and actually still goes into) the OpenGraph settings of that plugin. With this change, that development has been worth while even more. Google+, Facebook and Twitter now all use the basic OpenGraph tags like og:url, <code>og:description</code>, <code>og:title</code> and <code>og:image</code>.</p>\n<p>This means that for a full Twitter Cards implementation, you only really need to add three lines to your site. For instance for every post <a href=\"http://yoast.com/author/michiel/\">Michiel</a> writes on this site, we&#8217;d need to add this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; value=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; value=&quot;@yoast&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:creator&quot; value=&quot;@michielheijmans&quot;&gt;</pre>\n<p>All the other data would be taken from the OpenGraph metadata that&#8217;s already there. When I noticed this, I realized that the Twitter Card implementation for my SEO plugin would be a breeze; so I went ahead and build it. I&#8217;m currently waiting for access to their beta so I can test it, but the implementation is mostly done. It&#8217;ll add a Twitter contact field to every user&#8217;s profile using the <a href=\"http://yoast.com/user-contact-fields-wordpress/\">method I wrote about a few days ago</a>. Next to that it&#8217;ll allow you to set a site Twitter account and check a box to say you want to include the data, that&#8217;s it. If you want to have a play, the code is already in the WordPress SEO trunk, so you can download it from the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/developers/\">developers page</a>.</p>\n<h2>What Twitter Cards mean for OpenGraph</h2>\n<p>As you&#8217;ll understand, Twitter Cards made OpenGraph even more important than it already was. No site on the web should be without the basic OpenGraph meta data anymore. Microsoft recently announced <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/05/14/sharing-links-from-ie10-on-windows-8.aspx\">suport for OpenGraph in IE10</a> in Windows 8 as well, which just adds another reason.</p>\n<p>It makes sense too: the OpenGraph protocol is relatively easy yet allows for a bit more than just a meta description and title tag. So go forth and implement OpenGraph!</p>\n<h2>Merge it all into one standard</h2>\n<p>There are some things that obviously need to be worked on though. The fact that Twitter requires the <code>twitter:card</code> meta tag sort of annoys me, as it seems to me they could have just mapped the <code>og:type</code> meta tag for that, which would make implementation even easier. The same goes for the <code>og:url</code> meta tag, Facebook falls back to the <code>rel=canonical</code> element when it&#8217;s there and there is no <code>og:url</code> element, I&#8217;m hoping Twitter will do the same but they haven&#8217;t specified it yet.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/opengraph/\">Facebook group</a> that discusses the Open Graph Protocol I already saw <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/opengraph/permalink/447342028623970/\">Tantek Çelik say</a> what I was thinking:</p>\n<blockquote><p>og:&#8230; twitter:&#8230; &#8211; it&#8217;s like vendor prefixes for meta tags! looks like a good opportunity to create a microformat based on commonalities among all this vendor-specific work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>All I can say is: yes! Hell yes! Because before you know it, Pinterest will create some meta tags too, StumbleUpon will follow and we&#8217;ll have even more code spaghetti in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>s of our pages.</p>\n<p>For now though, I like what Twitter did with their Twitter Cards change, here&#8217;s to hoping I get into the beta soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Update September 5th, 2012:</strong> it now works for yoast.com!

We are happy that this is top-of-mind for some of you because its importance should not be understated.  Often we will receive emails from Clicky users asking why there was a dramatic lag in visitors tracked or a complete drop-off altogether.  While there can be many explanations, it is not uncommon that the site itself went down unbeknownst to the site owner.  Standard web analytics will not be able to tell you this, but site uptime monitoring and alerts will.<br />\n<br />\nWith this in mind, we are excited to announce a closed beta in partnership with Monitage, a newly-developed site uptime monitoring service by <a href=\'http://roxr.net\'>Roxr Software</a> (that\'s us).  We have integrated Monitage into Clicky to give you a bigger picture of the health and activity of your web sites. <br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201301-monitage/monitage.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMonitage monitors web sites from five locations around the world (three in the US, one in Paris, one in Japan) and only declares a downtime event if a majority of its servers agree on it. This prevents network hiccups on the monitoring end from sending false alarms.<br />\n<br />\nPro Plus users and above receive access to the Monitage closed beta. When we officially launch, you will have the ability to create up to 30 checks per site with intervals as fast as 1 minute, but during testing we want to keep resource usage within a reasonable range. So for the time being, we are limiting to 3 checks per site with a max interval of 5 minutes. We expect to officially launch within 4 weeks, at which point Monitage will also be available as a standalone service.<br />\n<br />\nTo access Monitage, go to your site dashboard and click the Uptime tab. You can create checks for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP, IMAP, IMAPS, and ICMP (ping). We\'ve also created a dashboard module.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201301-monitage/monitage-dashboard.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nYou can also access uptime stats from the API. Check the <a href=\'http://clicky.com/help/api\'>API docs</a> and search for uptime. type=uptime will give you the current status of all of your checks for a site. type=uptime-list will give you a chronological list of all downtime events for your site for the date range requested.<br />\n<br />\nLast, we added uptime stats as an option in email reports as well.<br />\n<br />\nWhen Monitage officially launches, we will determine what intervals and types of tests will be included with Clicky Pro Plus plans and above.<br />\n<br />\nWe are asking that you test Monitage, and let us know your thoughts, what you like, don\'t like, and want to see.  As Monitage is in its infancy, we want your feedback to help mature it into a stalwart companion to Clicky.<br />\n<br />\nNote to <a href=\'http://clicky.com/whitelabel/\'>white label</a> customers: Monitage will be added as an option to white label service when it officially launches, but for now it is only available to Clicky users.<br />\n<br />\n----<br />\n<b>Update, Feb 4:</b> Just pushed an update that integrates uptime monitoring into the Big Screen report. Also added web hooks to the setup page.

Yay!<br />\n<br />\nFor 6 years, our brand has always been Clicky. Excluding our domain name, nowhere on our site has the brand GetClicky ever been mentioned, other than some <a href=\'https://clicky.com/testimonials\'>testimonials</a> that we didn\'t edit. However, because of the old domain name, the majority people have always referred to us as GetClicky. It didn\'t help that our Twitter handle was also @getclicky, but we wanted it to match our domain name (bad idea). It\'s always kind of driven us insane, but it\'s been an interesting lesson. If you can afford the right domain name, do yourself a favor and buy it as soon as possible. We paid a pretty freaking penny for clicky.com, but the second it was in our possession was just pure unadulterated joy.<br />\n<br />\nWe\'ve had the <a href=\'http://twitter.com/clicky\'>@clicky</a> Twitter handle from the beginning, but it was just a placeholder. We\'ve now swapped @getclicky with @clicky so all of our followers and tweet history remains in place. Fun fact, Twitter does not offer an official method to do this - you have to actually relinquish your brand for a brief few seconds while you swap things around, which is extremely nerve racking to say the least. So @clicky became @clickyx, @getclicky became @clicky, and last @clickyx became @getclicky. Scary 20 seconds or so. Anyways, please note: If you tweet at us in the future, use @clicky, not @getclicky! But if you were already following us you will keep getting our tweets without having to do anything.<br />\n<br />\nAny page viewed on getclicky.com is now redirected to clicky.com, with a little note at the top about updating your bookmarks. That note will go away in a few weeks, but for now we want as many people to notice the change as possible.<br />\n<br />\n<b>You do NOT need to update your tracking code, because getclicky.com isn\'t going anywhere. Your existing tracking code, along with any integrations you have with the API, widgets, or whatever via getclicky.com, all will continue to work.</b> Going forward, getclicky.com will only be seen in the tracking code (we are using it indefinitely for tracking). And we\'ll continue to use it for email, for now at least, since that\'s a nightmare to change. So... clicky.com = web site domain, getclicky.com = tracking domain, email, and indefinite backwards compatibility.<br />\n<br />\nThis was not as easy as just acquiring clicky.com and pointing it to a new IP address. A service of our size and complexity, there\'s a LOT of things to deal with when changing your domain name. My checklist is ridiculous in length and I hope to go into it more in a later blog post.<br />\n<br />\nThere may be a few bugs lying around... we\'ll squash them tomorrow as they come to our attention.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=ZC0JeQFTdQ4:sRWwW4Pw6do:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=ZC0JeQFTdQ4:sRWwW4Pw6do:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=ZC0JeQFTdQ4:sRWwW4Pw6do:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=ZC0JeQFTdQ4:sRWwW4Pw6do:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=ZC0JeQFTdQ4:sRWwW4Pw6do:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/ZC0JeQFTdQ4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Dec 2012 00:34:27 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1355906067\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://clicky.com/blog/309/getclicky-no-more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"On-site analytics update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/Bwy9-g3NOEY/on-site-analytics-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://clicky.com/blog/307/on-site-analytics-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://clicky.com/blog/307/on-site-analytics-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2367:\"Just pushed a much needed tracking update for sub-user accounts, so now they can use <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/303/on-site-analytics>on-site analytics</a>, and their traffic will now also be automatically ignored.<br />\n<br />\nPreviously this was not possible because of the way our tracking servers were caching information about each site in memcached.

All sub-user accounts are created as Pro, since Pro has always had access to every feature, and a Pro account was required to have sub-user accounts. But now that heatmaps require Pro Plus or higher, heatmap tracking broke for some of you if you had created another sub-user account and assigned them admin access to a site in your account. Their account features were overriding yours on the tracking servers for the sites they had admin access to. So this update fixes that. But we went ahead anyways and made sub-users account types mirror the master accounts - any time the master account type changes, the sub-users are updated accordingly, to address any future updates that might cause this scenario to come up again.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=Bwy9-g3NOEY:WGEIAeVVhAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=Bwy9-g3NOEY:WGEIAeVVhAg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=Bwy9-g3NOEY:WGEIAeVVhAg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=Bwy9-g3NOEY:WGEIAeVVhAg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=Bwy9-g3NOEY:WGEIAeVVhAg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/Bwy9-g3NOEY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Nov 2012 14:00:46 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1353103246\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://clicky.com/blog/307/on-site-analytics-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Update on heatmaps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/_pH0LOHUxS0/update-on-heatmaps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"http://clicky.com/blog/306/update-on-heatmaps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"http://clicky.com/blog/306/update-on-heatmaps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1778:\"<a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/304/heatmaps>Heatmaps</a> launched four weeks ago.

Those bugs are fixed now, but that\'s beside the point of this little post.<br />\n<br />\nWeb browsers download page elements in the order that they are listed in your HTML - CSS, javascript, and images (mostly). If the domain that any of those are hosted on is offline or going slow, a web browser will hang for up to 60 seconds while it waits for the item to load, before moving on to the next item. (Asynchronous javascript is an exception but that\'s still not very common - although we do offer it an option - but again, that\'s not the point. And besides, if you\'re loading it asynchronously, you\'re not depending on it being available for immediate execution, so what would be the point of putting it in your HTML head?).<br />\n<br />\nIf you have third party javascript in your HTML head and that third party server goes offline, your web site is effectively dead because nothing else is going to load for up to 60 seconds. When I visit sites that hang like that, I immediately close them as I\'m sure 99% of people do.<br />\n<br />\nIf the javascript was instead in the footer of your web site, the web browser would still hang trying to download the item, but most of your site would already be loaded in the visitor\'s web browser. In other words, your site would still be (mostly) usable while the engineers for the third party service go into panic mode.<br />\n<br />\nOur CDN never really goes offline but there are obviously thousands of services out there that ask you to put their javascript on your web site. Any third party javascript code that\'s not <i>critical</i> to your web site working properly should never go in the HTML head. Tracking code, ad code, widgets, social plugins, etc - these are all non-critical and have no business up there. Help make the internet a better place and always put that code at the bottom of your web site, k?<br />\n<br />\nThe only valid exception here is if it\'s hosted by a major provider such as Google, and you rely on the functionality of that code as the page loads (which we do for Google\'s map API, but that\'s it). That is the only exception.<br />\n<br />\nSo... if you\'ve got our code in your HTML head, please move it instead to the bottom of your HTML, right before the closing /body tag, as has always been recommended on the page where you grab your tracking code from.<br />\n<br />\nBonus pro-tip: For <i>first party</i> elements, your CSS file should always be the very first item in your HTML head. That way your site will always look proper as soon as possible, beacuse this will be the very first thing the browser downloads after the HTML itself.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=VaU2-Rvd43w:EEhiqyjTZzo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=VaU2-Rvd43w:EEhiqyjTZzo:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=VaU2-Rvd43w:EEhiqyjTZzo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=VaU2-Rvd43w:EEhiqyjTZzo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=VaU2-Rvd43w:EEhiqyjTZzo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/VaU2-Rvd43w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Oct 2012 16:25:24 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1350516324\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://clicky.com/blog/305/please-do-not-place-third-party-javascript-in-your-html-head\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Heatmaps!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/b1b7przNipI/heatmaps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"http://clicky.com/blog/304/heatmaps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"http://clicky.com/blog/304/heatmaps\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9841:\"We\'ve got two great new features launching today, after nearly 4 months of development: heatmaps, and <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/blog/303/on-site-analytics\'>on-site analytics</a>.<br />\n<br />\nHere\'s an example of a heatmap report, after the new tracking code has been live on our site for a couple of hours:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/heatmaps.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n(Note: Everyone\'s user homepage is unique so some of the hot spots look weird here when conglomerated on a global scale. That\'s the nature of dynamic pages).<br />\n<br />\n<b class=red>IMPORTANT!</b> Heatmaps won\'t start logging anything until you specify your site\'s width and layout in your site preferences. You can see where to do that in <a href=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/site-prefs.png\'>this screenshot</a>. And as with on-site analytics, you must have the newest tracking code in your browser, so clear your cache!<br />\n<br />\nOver the years we\'ve had a lot of requests for this feature and we\'re psyched to finally offer it to you. But once we started on it, the idea for <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/blog/303/on-site-analytics\'>on-site analytics</a> was born soon thereafter, making this otherwise fairly-simple feature spiral out of control (in a good way). Hence nearly 4 months of development and testing!<br />\n<br />\nMost services, to view heatmaps, you go to their site (e.g. getclicky.com) and go to your heatmap report, click a button for the page you want to view heatmaps for, and then your site is opened in an iframe, and then a heatmap overlay is loaded on top. That\'s unideal for a lot of reasons, but particularly the iframe (ugh). Loading a site in an iframe introduces a lot of potential problems, and a lot of sites have frame busters that would totally break this feature. So we took a different approach.<br />\n<br />\nOk, we won\'t deny you the boring way, going to your reports and clicking the appropriate link in the Content report:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/content.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWhat we do differently is that your page loads directly in a new window with a special parameter in the URL fragment, that our tracking code recognizes and automatically loads a heatmap dynamically on your site - without a frame, and without requiring being logged in to Clicky (i.e. you can share the URL). So that\'s good.<br />\n<br />\n<img class=\'fr ml10 mb10\' src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/oss.png\'>But we thought it would be so terrific if you could just be on your web site and say I want a heatmap of this page, now and just click a button on that page and see it immediately. So that\'s what we did, and hence made it part of the <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/blog/303/on-site-analytics\'>on-site analytics</a> experience, as you can see to the right.<br />\n<br />\nThis was still not enough for us. Even though very few of our real-time competitors offer heatmaps, we didn\'t want to just make a me too feature. We believe most of the features we are releasing with our heatmaps are unlike anything that any other service offers.<br />\n<br />\n<b>First of all, beyond per page heatmaps, we also do per session.</b> <i>For every single page view of every session we log for your site</i>, we log a unique heatmap for that visitor. You can view session heatmaps by viewing a session, and next to each action, on the right-hand side, will be a heatmap icon to click if we have any heatmap data for that page/session combo. Click the icon to view all of their clicks on any given page:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/session.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Second, what would be analytics without segmentation?</b> You can view global heatmaps (all clicks) for any page, or you segment them by a number of criteria. For example, only view clicks on a page for people who completed a specific goal, or only people who arrived via a specific search or campaign or referring domain or type of referrer (e.g. advertising), or any/every version of every split test you\'re running.<br />\n<br />\nHere\'s an example of our homepage for users completing the new user goal. Unsurprising, the majority of the clicks are on the register now button:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/heatmaps-goals.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe order of items in these reports is a bit different than what you see on our web site. We take the top 24 items ordered by popularity, e.g. the top 24 goals completed today, then re-order them alphabetically. This is because we think you\'ll generally want to see the most popular segments but you\'ll also want to find them quickly - so instead of showing them in order of popularity, we grab the top ones and re-order them alphabetically so you can quickly narrow down what you\'re looking for in the interface.<br />\n<br />\nTo generate segmented heatmaps, we needed to add a new filter type to quickly find visitors with heatmap data attached. So we made this a general filter as well. In the main visitors report on Clicky, when you click add a filter, you will see a new option callled heatmaps. Click that to filter down your visitors to just people with heatmap data attached. This also works with the <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/help/api\'>analytics API</a>, by specifying heatmap=1 in combination with type=visitors or type=segmentation requests. (We also added a filter for online now, since we needed to be able to internally filter visitors who were online now in order to display in the widget. Via the API, use online=1).<br />\n<br />\nWhen viewing your visitors report, anyone with heatmap data attached will have a new icon next to them: <br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/visitors-list.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nNot every visitor will have heatmap data though... We anticipate this type of data to take up a lot of space, so for now we only do it for a random 50% of your visitors. We will likely adjust this in the future as we see what kind of impact it has on our resources. For example, it is quite likely we\'ll increase the sampling rate for low traffic sites, maybe even do all visitors, and for higher traffic sites, do less than 50%. But for now, just doing 50% was an easy safety measure and we\'ll analyze resource impact as time goes on.<br />\n<br />\nMost heatmaps use server-side image generation to overlay on your site, which takes up a lot of resources on the service providing the heatmap - and is also quite slow. Earlier this year we discovered the excellent open-source <a href=\'http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/\'>heatmaps.js</a> by Patrick Wied, and we knew that was just what we needed. This is a javascript library that generates the heatmap on the fly, using your web browser\'s resources, so it\'s fast and efficient. There are lots of features this library has that aren\'t yet documented, some of which we wanted to use (animated heatmaps for example) - but we didn\'t want to take the time to figure them out ourselves. We hope this library matures in the future and we\'ll take advantage of it when it does. But for now, for what we need, it does the job extremely well.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>A difficult decision</h3>This will be the first feature we offer that is not included in the standard Pro plan. The Pro plan has always had every feature we offer, so this was hard to do. But, the resources needed for this feature are quite significant, both in terms of bandwidth and storage, so we can\'t justify the standard Pro pricing for this feature.<br />\n<br />\nWe do want all of you to experience it first hand though, so for the first 4 weeks, all Pro or higher accounts will have this feature. After 4 weeks, a Pro Platinum or Custom plan will be required to keep the heatmap feature. <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/blog/303/on-site-analytics\'>On-site analytics</a> will be standard with any Pro or higher account, though.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Data retention</h3>As we said above, we anticipate this taking up a lot of storage space, so we built the database structure around monthly chunks that are auto-purged every 30 days. Initially, daily/session data will only be guaranteed for 30 days, but be available up to 60 days, and monthly data will only be guaranteed for 2 months, but available up to 3 months. It\'s hard to anticipate the exact impact this will have on our resources so we may (and hope to) expand this limit in the future, but for now, this is all we can guarantee.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Internet Explorer, may I count the ways in which I love thee?</h3>Prior to IE8, IE does not have native JSON support, and even then, only when your site runs in standards mode. IE causing developers headaches is as sure as the sun rising in the east, regardless, the point is that IE users will not have heatmap data logged unless they are on at least version 8 <i>and</i> your site renders in standards mode.

Click on it to view a list of said visitors! Up to 8 visitors are shown at a time, and you can page through them with the next page link in the top right corner. Click on the username (if you\'re using <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/help/customization\'>custom data tracking</a>) or IP address to view their session on Clicky:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/visitors.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nYou can also view several summary reports about the visitors onine, such as top searches, referrering domains, traffic sources, goals, and more.<br />\n<br />\n<img title=\'fucking secure searches\' src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201210-onsitestats/searches.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Visitors on this page</h3>The on page number represents how many visitors are currently viewing the page that you are currently viewing. Clicking on it shows the exact same type of reports as the global on site report, except it\'s limited to visitors currently viewing the same page that you are.<br />\n<br />\nThe on site and on page numbers will automatically update once per minute for 5 minutes, then once every 5 minutes for an hour, while you are idle on a single page on your web site. But after an hour, the updating will stop.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Heatmaps</h3>If you have enabled <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/blog/304/heatmaps\'>heatmap tracking</a> in your site preferences, and there is heatmap data in the last 7 days for the page you are currently viewing, you will see the heatmap icon on the right hand side (large colorful pixels). Click that to view a heatmap report for the page you\'re viewing for the current date, along with segmentation options for the heatmaps.<br />\n<br />\nThere\'s a lot to talk about with heatmaps, so we wrote a separate post for that. Read about <a href=\'http://getclicky.com/blog/304/heatmaps\'>heatmaps here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Other notes/features</h3><br />\n<li>Clicking on the Clicky Web Analytics link will open a new tab/window on getclicky.com with your site\'s dashboard.<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>On-site analytics requires <a href=\'http://jquery.com\'>jQuery</a></b>. We automatically check if your site already has it, and if not, we side-load it from our CDN - after which we call <a href=\'http://docs.jquery.com/Core/jQuery.noConflict\'>jQuery.noConflict()</a> to ensure we don\'t interfere with any other libraries you may have on your site that use the $() shortcut. In order for all features to work, we do require at least version 1.6, which is almost 30 months old - if you\'re on a version older than that, please upgrade ;)<br />\n<br />\n<li>To authenticate your access to on-site analytics, we had to cache your user cookie on the tracking servers. While we were at it, we went ahead and enabled ignoring your traffic to your own web site automatically, without having to set a IP filter / filter cookie. If you need to test something on your own web site and see it in Clicky, simply logout of Clicky or use a different web browser. We know this will be a PITA for some of you, but the majority of users want to ignore their own traffic so this makes sense for us to implement as a convenience feature.<br />\n<br />\n<li>Calls to clicky.log() are now stored in a cookie queue (unless you have disabled cookies), to help ensure these calls aren\'t missed. Previously we recommended calling clicky.pause() manually after any clicky.log() or clicky.goal() event that resulted in a new page view, as otherwise the call would almost never be logged.

Next time you\'re in Portland, kindly buy him a beer.</i><br />\n<br />\nClicky is almost 6 years old and hence was one of the first real-time web <i>analytics</i> platforms. Spy is an important part of that offering. Spy allows you to glimpse important information about active visitors on your website, as that information flows out of your visitors\' browsers and into our system.<br />\n<br />\nSpy has been a part of Clicky since the very beginning and has always been one of the most popular features. The name and functionality were both heavily influenced by Digg Spy. Sean, our lead developer, says that when he saw Digg Spy circa 2005, he thought to himself how sweet would it be if you had that kind of real time data stream, but for your own web site? That was in fact one of his motivations to create Clicky in the first place.<br />\n<br />\nSince 2006, we\'ve grown by leaps and bounds, and many parts of our service have had to absorb the shocks of scale. Recent tweets about our major data center move and infrastructure changes confirm this, but much is afoot at a deeper level than that meeting the eye. <br />\n<br />\nSpy has gone through multiple complete rewrites to get to where it is today. We thought some of you might find it interesting.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Initial implementation</h4>The first version of Spy was drafted in a few days. Back then, all infrastructure components for Clicky were located on a single machine (yikes).<br />\n<br />\nIncoming tracking data was simply copied to local storage in a special format, and retrieved anew when users viewed their Spy page. It was extremely simple, as most things are at small scale, but it worked.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201209-spyy/spyy1.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Spy, evolved</h4>By mid-2008, we had moved to a multi-server model: one web server, one tracking server, and multiple database servers. But the one tracking server was no longer cutting it. We needed to load balance the tracking, which meant Spy needed to change to support that.<br />\n<br />\nWhen load balancing was completed, any incoming tracking hit was sent to a random tracking server. This meant that each dedicated tracking server came to store a subset of Spy data. Spy, in turn, had to open multiple sockets per request to extract and aggregate viewing data. Given X tracking servers, Spy had to open X sockets, and perform X^2 joins and sorts before emitting the usage data to the user\'s web browser.<br />\n<br />\nInitially the Spy data files were served via Apache from all of the tracking servers, but that tied up resources that were needed for tracking. Soon after this setup, our first employee (no longer with us) (Hi Andy!) wrote a tiny python script that ran as a daemon on each tracking server. It took over serving the Spy files for the PHP process on the web server that was requesting them. This helped free up precious HTTP processes for tracking, but there was still a lot of resources being wasted because of the storage method we were using.<br />\n<br />\nTracking servers had no mechanism for granularly controlling the memory consumed by its Spy data. Therefore, each tracking server had a cron job that would indiscriminately trim its respective Spy data. Sometimes, however, this mechanism would grow out of control, so trims happened randomly when users viewed their Spy page. These competing mechanisms and their implementations presented an opportunity for datum linearity issues to arise occasionally.<br />\n<br />\nThe number of websites we tracked continued rising, and we made several changes to this implementation to keep resource usage in check. Among them was the move to writing Spy data to shared memory (/dev/shm) instead of the hard drive. This helped a great deal initially, but as time wore on, it became clear that this was just not going to scale much further without a complete rethinking of Spy.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201209-spyy/spyy2.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Trimming the fat</h4>In the end, we decided to reimplement Spy\'s backend from the ground up. We devised a list of gripes that we had with Spy, and it looked like this:<br />\n<br />\n*N tracking servers meant N sockets opened/closed on every request for data<br />\n*Data had to be further aggregated and then sorted on every request<br />\n*Full list of Spy data for a site was transmitted on every request, which consumed massive bandwidth (over 5MB/sec <i>per tracking server</i> on internal network) and required lots of post-processing by PHP<br />\n<br />\nOur goals looked like this:<br />\n<br />\n*Improve throughput<br />\n*Improve efficiency<br />\n*Reduce network traffic<br />\n*Reduce per-request and overall resource usage<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Enter Spyy</h4>The modern version of Spy, called Spyy to fit in with our internal naming conventions, is implemented in two custom daemons written in C. The first runs on each tracking server and dumbly forwards incoming Spy data to the second daemon, the Spy master. Data travels over a persistent socket established by <a href=\'http://www.zeromq.org/\'>ZeroMQ</a>.<br />\n<br />\nThe Spy master daemon stores the information efficiently for each site, using a circular buffer whose size is determined and periodically reevaluated by a site\'s traffic rate. This removes the need to manually trim any data from a site as we\'ve been doing for years. Once the buffer is filled for a site, old data is automatically purged as new data arrives. When we read data from the new daemon, it gives us only the data we need (basically, since timestamp X) instead of all data for site X, drastically reducing network bandwidth and post-processing needed to be done by PHP.<br />\n<br />\nLike the previous version of Spy, all data is stored in RAM to ensure peak performance. Because of this, however, the data is still volatile. We have other mechanisms for permanently storing tracking data, and Spy data excludes much information from what is permanently stored. This means that when we implement new features or apply bugfixes to Spyy, it must be killed and started anew.<br />\n<br />\nTo mitigate this blip in the availability of data, we have implemented a rudimentary transfer mechanism between the existing Spy program and a new one coming online to take its place. This mechanism also uses ZeroMQ and, basically, drains datums from the existing process to the new process. At completion, the old process shuts itself down and the new process claims its occupied network interfaces.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201209-spyy/spyy3.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Conspycuous benefits</h4>We met our goals, and then some. The overall project took about 8 weeks.<br />\n<br />\nBenchmarks at the start of the project demonstrated the old Spy implementation barely able to keep up at peak load, tapping out at about 5,000 reqs/sec. In comparison, the new implementation can handle upwards of 50,000 reqs/sec on the same hardware.<br />\n<br />\nIn the old architecture, read performance decreased as the number of tracking servers increased. In the new architecture, read performance is unaffected by the number of tracking servers, and is roughly 2N times better than the old architecture, assuming at least 1 tracking server N. Write performance in both cases is constant.<br />\n<br />\nRAM usage for storing Spy data was approximately 4GB per tracking server under the old architecture. At the time we had 5 tracking servers which meant 20GB total (we have 7 tracking servers now). New Spy, on the other hand, only uses up 6GB total RAM on a single virtual machine, and it takes up so little CPU power that the same server hardware also hosts one tracking server and four database servers without issue.<br />\n<br />\nBandwidth wise, the old Spy used over 20MB/sec of combined bandwidth for read requests from the tracking servers. New Spy? About 500KB/sec on average, reducing network footprint to barely 1% of what it was before.<br />\n<br />\nIn the event of a Spy master server outage, our tracking servers simply drop Spyy-bound packets automatically and continue persisting other data to disk, with absolutely no performance impact.<br />\n<br />\nBecause of the way that ZeroMQ is implemented, we can scale this architecture very readily and rapidly. It removed a lot of application complexity and let us focus on the implementation. With ZeroMQ, business logic itself drives the network topology.<br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, because of ZeroMQ, we can easily segment sites out onto different Spy masters with little change to the rest of Clicky, should the need or desire arise. In fact, we already do this because of some legacy white label customers (which we, of course, thank for the challenge provided by their existence in this implementation).<br />\n<br />\nAs stated above, redundancy is not a goal of ours for Spy, because of the volatile and transient nature of its data. But if we ever change our mind, we can simply set up a ZeroMQ device between the tracking servers and Spy master, and have each datum be split off to N master servers.<br />\n<br />\nOverall, we are extremely happy with the improvements made. We are also very impressed with ZeroMQ. It has been getting quite a bit of hype recently, and in our opinion it lives up to it.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=MCm4XSt-HoI:39N56HlUzA0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=MCm4XSt-HoI:39N56HlUzA0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=MCm4XSt-HoI:39N56HlUzA0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=MCm4XSt-HoI:39N56HlUzA0:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=MCm4XSt-HoI:39N56HlUzA0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/MCm4XSt-HoI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Sep 2012 14:13:18 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1348175598\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://clicky.com/blog/302/history-of-spy-also-zeromq-rocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"Jigsaw company API integration is dead and we&#039;re looking for alternatives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/8P6XqK2U7n4/jigsaw-company-api-integration-is-dead-and-were-looking-for-alternatives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"http://clicky.com/blog/301/jigsaw-company-api-integration-is-dead-and-were-looking-for-alternatives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"http://clicky.com/blog/301/jigsaw-company-api-integration-is-dead-and-were-looking-for-alternatives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2584:\"About two weeks ago, our integration with <a rel=nofollow href=\'http://www.jigsaw.com/\'>Jigsaw</a> broke. Jigsaw is (was) a crowdsourced database of information on businesses, mainly US ones but some in Europe and other places too. It let us provide you with information like <a href=\'http://cdn.staticstuff.net/media/screenshots/201002-jigsaw-display.gif\'>this</a>.<br />\n<br />\nWe looked into it and discovered that our API key got revoked. We did some digging and realized that Jigsaw had been bought out by SalesForce last year, and Salesforce has decided to kill free access to this API, which apparently became effective around September 1.<br />\n<br />\nThe API is still available, if you\'re willing to pay. We are <i>definitely</i> willing to pay for this kind of data, but the price is $25,000/year. That works out to just over $2,000/month, which would make it our biggest monthly expense, other than payroll. Sorry, can\'t justify that.<br />\n<br />\nFor now, we have modified the links that pulled in this data to instead just open up a Google search page with the organization name pre-filled. In some ways this is actually better because Google will almost always find the company in question, regardless of physical location, whereas with Jigsaw, when I wanted to look up info on a company it was only maybe 50% success rate. With Google you\'ll have to do a bit of work on your end to find the details that we were previously providing, but at least it\'s something.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Alternatives?</h3>If you know of an alternative service that is reasonably priced and includes an API, please let us know. We haven\'t found anything worthwhile as of yet. A lot of these services seem more geared towards providing you with leads at these companies, rather than just information about the companies themselves, which is not what we\'re really interested in at the moment.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=8P6XqK2U7n4:4uhLfmXgfxM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=8P6XqK2U7n4:4uhLfmXgfxM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=8P6XqK2U7n4:4uhLfmXgfxM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=8P6XqK2U7n4:4uhLfmXgfxM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=8P6XqK2U7n4:4uhLfmXgfxM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/8P6XqK2U7n4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Sep 2012 14:27:27 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1347917247\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"http://clicky.com/blog/301/jigsaw-company-api-integration-is-dead-and-were-looking-for-alternatives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"We&#039;re moving!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/JO9F1gaN3LI/were-moving\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"http://clicky.com/blog/299/were-moving\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"http://clicky.com/blog/299/were-moving\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3043:\"This Saturday, August 4, from approximately 2pm to 5pm PST (GMT -0700), our web site will be offline while we move our servers to a new data center in downtown Portland.<br />\n<br />\nWe have carefully planned this over the last 3 weeks to ensure that tracking will still be online during this time (no data will be lost and there will be no impact on your site\'s performance), and that the move itself will be as fast as humanly possible. The new data center is already pre-railed and pre-wired with power and ethernet, so de-racking and re-racking will be extremely fast. So why will it take ~3 hours? Well, the old data center is about 90 miles away... :(<br />\n<br />\nNew machines are already setup at the new data center to support tracking during the move. When the database servers get plugged in here, they will automatically start parsing the ~3 hour back log of traffic they will each have waiting for them on the tracking servers. It will take a good 3-6 hours from that point for all servers to catch back up with real time again.<br />\n<br />\nThis is something we\'ve wanted to do for a while but as we grew to over 50 physical servers, it became unfeasible. However, thanks to our full virtualization that was completed in June after many months of work, we are down to just 11 physicals! Suddenly this dream became a real possibility so we jumped at the opportunity to make it happen before we needed to add any more hardware to the rack.<br />\n<br />\nTo say we\'re excited would be the understatement of the year. We\'ve been with the same host as we\'ve grown to enormous bandwidth over 6 years, so they\'ve had to grow with us, which has been the cause of most of our major outages. The new data center is enterprise class with internet connectivity across 8 unique providers, so problems with internet connectivity should be near zero. Portland is much more major hub than where we were before, so connectivity should also be significantly faster, especially for those of you outside the US. Last, being 15 minutes away from our data center instead of 90 will be a very welcome change when we need to take a trip there.<br />\n<br />\nA lot of time has been spent over the last 4 months on backend/sysadmin work like this, which has interrupted our regular flow of feature releases.

If you\'re <i>not</i> logging custom data, you should - it\'s one of our best features. <br />\n<br />\nUp until yesterday, for our own reports on getclicky.com we have only been logging usernames of those of you logged in to our site. This adds a lot of personality to the visitor reports. But a lot of you log a lot more types of data such as shopping cart information, account status, things like that. I\'ve been wanting to add summary reports for this custom data for quite a while, not only for you, but also because there were other types of data we were interested in seeing about who is using our service on a day to day basis. There wasn\'t much point though since there was no way to see a summary of it. But now there is!<br />\n<br />\nIf you log custom data, you will see a new item in the main tabs when viewing your site. And if you don\'t log custom data, this item doesn\'t show up. Here\'s what the main report looks like: <br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201206-custom/custom-report.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAs you can see, when someone is logged in to Clicky, we\'re now also tracking what type of account they have and how long they\'ve been a member. And we added support for attaching goals to this data, so we can see what goals the different types of accounts are completing, as well as their revenue (hidden here).<br />\n<br />\nWhat I really love is that the sub-tabs for this Custom report are dynamically generated based on the different types of custom data you\'ve been logging to your site. So you can click on any of those sub-tabs to see a report for just that family of data, or, you can just click the \'more...\' link at the bottom of any family, just like other family style reports (browsers etc - speaking of which, some of those were broken because of horrible code, and have now been fixed as well as optimized to generate faster). (Note: Internally, data types that have parents and chidlren are called families, in case you are confused).<br />\n<br />\nYou can click any of the items in this report to immediately see all visitors with that custom data attached to them, and you can also click any parent, for example account type, to see all visitors who have any account type data attached to them, no matter what its value is.<br />\n<br />\nNot done yet!<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\'http://getclicky.com/blog/286/long-term-metrics-and-other-goodies\'>The new goal report</a> we released about 4 months ago has been a big hit. We thought it would be pretty great to see custom data in this report too, so we added it: (Screenshot has been slightly modified to make it smaller)<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201206-custom/custom-goals.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe also created a dashboard module for custom data, and the sub-tabs are dynamically generated just like they are for the main custom report:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201206-custom/custom-dashboard.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLast but not least, all of these items are graphable too. Just click the trend percentage next to any custom data in any report (main report, dashboard, goal report) to see its history over time. Of course, we\'ve only been logging this data for our stats for about 24 hours so it\'s not terribly exciting yet:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201206-custom/custom-graph.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIf you use custom data with Clicky, we think this will be a nice addition. And if you\'re not using it yet, you really ought to look into it.

This is a great law because <i>finally</i>, all privacy issues will be permanently eradicated from the internet.<br />\n<br />\nIf there was ever an example of politicians really getting the internet, it would be this. The law requires that you list on your web site all of the cookies that get set by your web site, and the purpose of each cookie. Not even session cookies, or Javascript cookies that are never sent anywhere but simply used as boolean flags, are exempt; and this makes sense, because cookies of this nature are infamous in hacker circles for their unparalleled ability to steal your credit card, read your email, and sleep with your wife. The law also requires you to get opt in permission from a visitor before any cookies can be set. Redirecting every visitor to a page with this information and the ability to opt in to cookies is a great solution, because every additional step between a visitor and a conversion increases revenue by 10x, according to a study from AreYouFreakingKiddingMe, LLC.<br />\n<br />\nWe just updated our <a href=http://getclicky.com/terms#privacy>privacy policy</a> to list all of the cookies that may get set by your site if you have Clicky installed on it, in case you need it. If this law applies to your web site, we\'re sorry, but you can either explain all of this to your visitors and let them opt in, or follow the instructions <a href=http://getclicky.com/help/customization#cookies_disable>here</a> to disable cookies.<br />\n<br />\nWe\'ve had the option to disable cookies in tracking for a while, however that was created back when we only had one cookie (the tracking cookie). Since then we have added several more, whose purpose is to make the code more efficient and save resources on our end from deactivated/non-paying site (these being the session/boolean cookies mentioned above). Up until now, disabling cookies had no effect on these extra cookies. Because they were never sent to us, we didn\'t think it would matter. And it shouldn\'t. But now it does. Our tracking code has been updated so all cookies will be disabled now when this option is set (except one, but that will only be set for sites that are no longer using Clicky but still have the code installed, which is against our terms of service).<br />\n<br />\n<b>UPDATE</b>: A user pointed out that Cloudflare still sets a cookie. We use them for our CDN (static.getclicky.com). Their wiki <a href=http://support.cloudflare.com/kb/troubleshooting/can-i-disable-cloudflare-cookies>says</a> that cookies cannot be disabled. We have reached out to them for their plans regarding this law and will update you when we know more.<br />\n<br />\n<b>UPDATE</b>: Interestingly, the BBC, one of the biggest UK web sites, <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/privacy/cookies/managing/cookie-settings.html>specifically states</a> on their new cookie settings page that they embed third party items such as Youtube and Flickr that set cookies and that these are beyond their control so those cookies will still be set no matter how they decide about cookies served directly by BBC. Does this mean that sites embedding third party content or services, such as Clicky, are exempt from having to worry about these kinds of cookies? Who knows, but it\'s interesting.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=3KWmMPFK4Uc:tuFzTBf1yXc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=3KWmMPFK4Uc:tuFzTBf1yXc:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=3KWmMPFK4Uc:tuFzTBf1yXc:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=3KWmMPFK4Uc:tuFzTBf1yXc:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=3KWmMPFK4Uc:tuFzTBf1yXc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/3KWmMPFK4Uc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 22 May 2012 15:47:51 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1337726871\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://clicky.com/blog/296/cookies-and-you-an-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"Database server migrations over the next couple of weeks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/CjrQD08Cd3E/database-server-migrations-over-the-next-couple-of-weeks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"http://clicky.com/blog/295/database-server-migrations-over-the-next-couple-of-weeks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"http://clicky.com/blog/295/database-server-migrations-over-the-next-couple-of-weeks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1664:\"We\'re migrating to a new server infrastructure over the next couple of weeks, which means all of our database servers will be finding new homes.

I\'ve been testing it for several months now with very aggressive settings and it\'s had zero impact on my battery life.<br />\n<br />\nWhy a widget and not a full blown app? We don\'t believe our resources are best spent maintaining an app that tries to do (almost) everything our web site does. Apps are much costlier to write and keep up to date. We are constantly adding new features and reports and tracking new types of data, etc. A simple widget living on your desktop (still one of my favorite Android features) that lets you keep up with your basic stats with a quick glance, with a few more details available when you click the widget (as shown <a href=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-android-widget/click.png>here</a>), fits the bill perfectly for us.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Handy dandy installation guide</h3><ol><li>Since this is a beta, we\'re not releasing it through the official marketplace just yet. So you\'ll need to enable the option to install apps from unknown sources in order to install this on your phone.<br />\n<br />\n- Android 4.0+, go to <i>Settings -> Security -> Unknown sources</i> (checkbox). <br />\n- Android 2.0+, go to <i>Settings -> Applications -> Unknown sources</i> (see a small guide <a href=http://www.androidcentral.com/allow-app-installs-unknown-sources>here</a>)<br />\n<br />\n<li><a class=clicky_log_download href=http://static.getclicky.com/apps/android/ClickyWidgetBeta.apk>Download this file</a> onto your phone!<br />\n<br />\n<li>Once completed, click the item in your notification bar (<a href=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-android-widget/download-complete.png>screenshot</a>) and install.<br />\n<br />\n<li>Setup a widget! The first time you do this, it will prompt for your username and password but you\'ll only have to do that once.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Important note:</b> Widgets don\'t have icons you click to open them up like standard apps do. Instead, you must install the widget onto your Android desktop before it can be used.<br />\n<br />\nIn Android 4.0+, there is a new <a href=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-android-widget/choose-widget.png>dedicated widgets area</a> in your app drawer, so go into there and long-press on the widget you want, then place it on the desktop. Older versions of Android, you\'ll need to long-press on your desktop until a menu pops up, then select widgets then find Clicky. There are three widgets to choose from.<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>Android 4.0 potential installation bug</b> - sometimes, on Android 4.0, you have to install the downloaded file <i>twice</i> before it will show up in your widget drawer. This only happens on 4.0 and only sometimes, we\'re not sure what causes it yet, but if you don\'t see the widget after installing it, install it again and it will show up.</ol><br />\n<br />\nThat\'s all there is to it. As mentioned above, you can add one or more widgets to your desktop for every site in your account, and data is pulled in a very battery friendly manner.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a beta so we want your feedback and bug reports. We hope to have an official release on the marketplace within 1 month!<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-android-widget/desktop.png\'><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=iJv1K6CHO5w:RNfRaGiuQ2U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=iJv1K6CHO5w:RNfRaGiuQ2U:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=iJv1K6CHO5w:RNfRaGiuQ2U:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=iJv1K6CHO5w:RNfRaGiuQ2U:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=iJv1K6CHO5w:RNfRaGiuQ2U:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/iJv1K6CHO5w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Mar 2012 11:50:58 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1332269458\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://clicky.com/blog/294/android-widget-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"blogspot tracking issue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/MpIDVaDuNHQ/blogspot-tracking-issue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://clicky.com/blog/293/blogspot-tracking-issue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://clicky.com/blog/293/blogspot-tracking-issue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2444:\"[Update: This has been fixed!]<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday, Google appears to have made a change that\'s affecting tracking for blogspot.com hosted sites. A significant portion of our userbase is tracking blogspot.com sites so we want to get this figured out as fast as possible.<br />\n<br />\nThe issue is strange. The majority of people saying tracking broke, it\'s only affecting visitors from Germany. This raises a red flag to me, as I know Germany has strict privacy laws. Google may have agreed to block third party scripts from loading for people who visit blogspot.com sites and live in Germany. That\'s a stretch but... who knows.<br />\n<br />\nAnother possibility is that Google is forcing their dynamic view templates on visitors in certain countries now, either as a test or that\'s just the way it is. I know that it is not possible to track blogspot sites that use this new format, so that would explain it. However it seems strange Google would do such a thing, especially without publicly announcing it first. The last post on their <a href=http://buzz.blogger.com/>blog</a> was 3 weeks ago.<br />\n<br />\nThe frustrating thing is that everyone who has contacted us, I\'ve gone to their site and verified the code is still installed. I click around on multiple pages, then view their visitor report on Clicky and verify every page I viewed was logged correctly. So everything seems fine. The code is there. I get tracked. But the stats for all of these sites are definitely way off compared to last week, so yes, something is wrong - but it\'s not on our end.<br />\n<br />\nAnd of course, there\'s no way to contact Google about this, other than praying they see this post.<br />\n<br />\nDoes anyone know what is going on or have any ideas?<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=MpIDVaDuNHQ:vIclsIVE-MA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=MpIDVaDuNHQ:vIclsIVE-MA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=MpIDVaDuNHQ:vIclsIVE-MA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=MpIDVaDuNHQ:vIclsIVE-MA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=MpIDVaDuNHQ:vIclsIVE-MA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/MpIDVaDuNHQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 12:40:30 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1332186030\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://clicky.com/blog/293/blogspot-tracking-issue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Filter visitors by time spent online\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/7LpX7l82fCQ/filter-visitors-by-time-spent-online\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"http://clicky.com/blog/292/filter-visitors-by-time-spent-online\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"http://clicky.com/blog/292/filter-visitors-by-time-spent-online\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1709:\"We\'ve had the ability to filter by actions, e.g. exactly 10, or greater than 10, or less than 10, for quite a while now, but we didn\'t have the same things for time spent online.

That was almost 2 years ago but as of today, we now finally support these cookies too.<br />\n<br />\nWhen viewing the details of a visitor session, there used to be a name this visitor link next to their IP address. We\'ve reworded this to just say tag, but there\'s now two of these links: one for the IP and one for the UID so you can click either one.<br />\n<br />\nIn site preferences, the sub-menu has been renamed from IP tags  filters to Visitor tags  filters, and in here you can manage all of them. When creating one from scratch, we determine if it\'s an IP or a UID based on the pattern of the string you enter. UID\'s are just numbers like 123456 so if that\'s what you enter, we\'ll use it for UID tagging or filtering. If however it\'s standard IP format (1.2.3.4) then it will be a normal IP tag/filter as has always been. <br />\n<br />\nThat may sound confusing but the good news is that the vast vast majority of you create tags and filters directly from the session details page, so you don\'t have to worry about the number you\'re actually entering, it\'s done for you automatically.

We\'re releasing as beta because there are still a few quirks and we want your bugs reports and feedback on the interface and what you think it could do better. This is a Pro or higher feature, of course.<br />\n<br />\nPart of what took so long was making it fast, because we know our visitor filtering isn\'t exactly the fastest thing in the world, especially for high traffic sites over large date ranges. But we are limiting this to a maximum range of 31 days at once for the time being, to make sure resource usage doesn\'t get too ridiculous, until we know how you are using it.<br />\n<br />\nThere are two different features in this release.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Simple path analysis</h3>I like this one because it\'s quick and dirty and requires zero forethought. When viewing your Content or Events reports (planning to add downloads and outbounds later), you\'ll see an icon next to each item:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-path-analysis/pa-segment-icon.png><br />\n<br />\nClick this icon (not the star, the other one!) to see an inline popup of the top 30 next and previous pages, for whatever date range you are viewing. If you\'re interested in seeing top next/previous pages for a page listed in <i>there</i>, click it and it will keep on going. Here\'s a good example for our upgrade page:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-path-analysis/pa-segment-1.png><br />\n<br />\nThe top previous page is /user/. Makes sense as that\'s the starting point for most registered visitors, and there are links to upgrade right from that page.<br />\n<br />\nSecond previous page is /user/sites - this is where people register new sites on Clicky. If they\'re at or over their limits for how many sites they can track or how much traffic they\'re allowed, we prompt them to upgrade first.<br />\n<br />\nThird previous page is <a href=http://getclicky.com/compare/>/compare/</a>, which is our competitor comparison matrix. From our upgrade page, we have a link to this comparison matrix, so people can compare our pricing and feature set, which we think will help win over more customers since most of our competitors are 400+% more expensive than us (ouch!). So how would this be a <i>previous</i> page? Well, after people look at it, they go back to the upgrade page! Well, some of them anyways :|<br />\n<br />\nThe next two aren\'t horribly relevant but the sixth one, /user/users is. That\'s where you add additional user accounts. If you\'re at your user limit or your account doesn\'t have access to that feature, then we say, hey, you gotta upgrade!<br />\n<br />\nI could go on all day but the point is simply that seeing what pages are actually pushing people towards paying us for our service is extremely interesting. I of course had a hunch about these most popular paths since I designed the entire flow of our web site, but I didn\'t actually <i>know</i>. Now I do and it\'s great!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Real path analysis</h3>This other aspect is much more powerful but takes longer to setup. That\'s to be expected of course, and if you take the time to do so it is pretty fantastic. In the future, we plan to group this together with goals for multi-step funnels. That\'s not making the initial cut though.<br />\n<br />\nTo reach this report, go to Content, then the Path Analysis sub-tab. It gives a brief overview of how to use it. Click the link at the top to start analyzing. Once you enter in some paths and click run analysis on the bottom right, it will analyze your input and return a report like the one below. This example is fairly simplistic but I don\'t want to showcase too many private details of our business here.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-path-analysis/pa-infinity.png><br />\n<br />\nUntil we integrate this into goals, you can use this as a kind of faux multi-funnel goal system, because you can save paths to quickly access them later.<br />\n<br />\nImportant note: In the screenshot above, see how the green arrow on the right has a little break in it? This represents infinite steps in between each path. In other words, it means the visitor didn\'t necessary go directly from the first page to the next, but after viewing the first they <i>eventually</i> viewed the second one. This is always the default when adding new paths in this interface. But if you only want to analyze <i>direct</i> path 1 -> path 2 flow, just click that arrow and it will become closed, representing a direct step:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201203-path-analysis/pa-infinity-not.png><br />\n<br />\nAfter you make that change, you will have to click the Run Analysis button again. In fact, any change you make in this interface you will have to do that. The reason for this is if we were auto refreshing it with every change you made, it would take a lot longer to create exactly the report you want. So instead, we let you do all the steps you want first, and only process it when you tell us too. This is an important note because it works differently than all other reports on Clicky, which all react instantly to anything you click.<br />\n<br />\nSo, play around with it and let us know of any bugs you find or additional features you\'d like. Barring any serious bugs, we\'re going to take at least a few weeks break from this because we could really use it. So we\'d expect that the official release with some of your suggestions and hopefully all bug fixes would be out in about 1 month.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=QrG0PjjgjL0:BrkAVlDeffY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=QrG0PjjgjL0:BrkAVlDeffY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=QrG0PjjgjL0:BrkAVlDeffY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=QrG0PjjgjL0:BrkAVlDeffY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=QrG0PjjgjL0:BrkAVlDeffY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/QrG0PjjgjL0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Mar 2012 16:49:57 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1331081397\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://clicky.com/blog/289/path-analysis-beta-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"Database maintenance this weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/ghLfjEFlVTI/database-maintenance-this-weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://clicky.com/blog/288/database-maintenance-this-weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://clicky.com/blog/288/database-maintenance-this-weekend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1854:\"Database servers 1-3, 6-10, and 14-33 will halt traffic processing for up to 10 hours this weekend while we perform some necessary maintenance.

For example, instead of linking to http://getclicky.com/123 (affiliate link), you might link to http://yoursite.com/go/clicky instead. This page then redirects the person on to the real link.<br />\n<br />\nThe problem with this has been that our tracking code has no idea what\'s actually going to happen once someone clicks that link. Without actually following the link, it simply appears to be an internal link, so we ignore it by default. There have always been several ways to track these links (<a href=http://getclicky.com/help/customization#csstags>CSS tagging</a> and <a href=http://getclicky.com/help/customization/manual#internal>manual data logging</a>), however these methods required way too much pain on your end. We don\'t like pain.<br />\n<br />\nSo, we added a new customizable tracking variable today, called <a href=http://getclicky.com/help/customization#outbound_pattern>outbound_pattern</a>. This allows you tell our tracking code, with just a few lines of code in one place, what your redirect URLs look like so that we can track clicks on them automatically. You can define it as a string, if there\'s only one pattern we should be looking for (should apply to most of you), or if you have multiple patterns, you can define more than one in an array.<br />\n<br />\nThe most common redirect URLs that I\'ve seen are one of these three:<br />\n<br />\nhttp://yoursite.com/go/clicky<br />\nhttp://yoursite.com/outbound/clicky<br />\nhttp://yoursite.com/aff/clicky<br />\n<br />\nWhat you\'ll want to use as your custom outbound pattern is the the base part of these URLs, e.g. \'/go/\' or \'/outbound/\' or \'/aff/\'. You\'ll want to make sure whatever it is you use though is unique to your redirects, otherwise other links may start getting logged as well.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Single pattern example:</b><br />\nvar clicky_custom = {};<br />\nclicky_custom.outbound_pattern = \'/go/\';<br />\n<br />\n<b>Multiple pattern example:</b><br />\nvar clicky_custom = {};<br />\nclicky_custom.outbound_pattern = [\'/go/\', \'/aff/\'];<br />\n<br />\nThis code would go directly <i>above</i> your existing tracking code. And wrapped in HTML script tags of course.<br />\n<br />\nIf you\'re running WordPress, our plugin has been updated to support this new functionality as well.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>iframe tracking</h3>A while back, we <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/281/iframe-tracking-copying-dashboards-google-search-encoding-etc>tried</a> to make tracking iframes better, in an automated way. This ended up causing some problems though so we killed it fast. Now we\'re bringing it back, but it\'s disabled by default so it will only process if that\'s what you want it to do.<br />\n<br />\nHere\'s the problem. If the tracking code is installed in an iframe, we track the iframe, but in most cases your goal is to track the parent document instead. Otherwise the page URLs and page titles you see in our reports will be for the iframe itself, and we won\'t be able to log referrers.<br />\n<br />\nSo, if your goal is to track the parent document but can only put the code in an iframe or widget (e.g. with Apple\'s iWeb), set <a href=http://getclicky.com/help/customization#iframe>clicky_custom.iframe=1</a>, so that our code will grab the parent\'s URL, title, and referrer.<br />\n<br />\n99% of you that have the code in an iframe, your goal is to actually track the parent document. If this applies to you, set this variable, and you should be good to go.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=5ItS4O_aiEg:TIzYaaISkec:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=5ItS4O_aiEg:TIzYaaISkec:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=5ItS4O_aiEg:TIzYaaISkec:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=5ItS4O_aiEg:TIzYaaISkec:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=5ItS4O_aiEg:TIzYaaISkec:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/5ItS4O_aiEg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Feb 2012 12:03:01 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1329336181\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"http://clicky.com/blog/287/custom-outbound-link-pattern-matching-and-iframe-tracking\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"Long term metrics, and other goodies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/gnUmyrSWVGQ/long-term-metrics-and-other-goodies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://clicky.com/blog/286/long-term-metrics-and-other-goodies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://clicky.com/blog/286/long-term-metrics-and-other-goodies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10840:\"Our newest update is all about the long term, and it\'s one of the best things we\'ve ever done. I\'d recommend grabbing a fresh pair of pants before reading on because you\'re going to need them before you\'re done reading this.<br />\n<br />\nIt all started out innocently enough: A fairly simple update to goals that before I knew it had morphed into something else entirely. 80% of the stuff in this update was never planned, all of these ideas just starting coming to me as I kept working on it. Hmmm this would be sweet, oh this too, oh and this... Within days my bullet point todo list for this update was ridiculously long and ended up taking almost 3 weeks to complete. But that\'s the way it usually goes when I feel I\'m on to something good.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>New goal report</h3>The main goal report still looks the same - until you click on a goal, that is. This new single goal report is awesome. Here\'s an example of one goal we track for new users registering with Clicky:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201202-long-term-metrics/goals.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTalking points:<br />\n<ul><li><b>You can now graph all goal metrics</b> (conversions, conversion rate, revenue [not shown], visits to goal, and time to goal), simply by clicking on any of those large-sized metrics at the top of the report. Previously you could only graph conversions. We\'ve had a million requests to graph this other data - now you finally can. We considered graphing all of them at once but they all have vastly different scales and it simply did not work well.<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>This visit and first visit</b> - Like most non-enterprise level services, Clicky <i>used</i> to only give you this visit data, e.g. data from the current session where the visitor converted. While interesting, most visitors do not convert on their first visit to your web site, so this data doesn\'t show the long term effects of your marketing efforts - example, which campaign they originally came in from when they bought something two weeks later, or what site they originally were referred by, if any.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that\'s exactly what first visit is all about. When a visitor converts, we now look up both their current session <i>and</i> their very first session on your site (that we know about it) immediately and summarize it in a table that lets us generate this report really fast, even over large date ranges. I can pull up this new report for a 30 day date range for any of the goals we track in less than 1 second. Not bad!<br />\n<br />\nGoing down these two new columns are five categories (only two are shown here to keep the size reasonable). These categories are campaigns, referring domains, searches, split tests, and goals, which we feel are the most relevant metrics to track in relation to tracking conversions. Previously you could see this data if you filtered your visitors by a goal then chose the appropriate segment, but we wanted to bring these important metrics front and center and make it load super fast.<br />\n<br />\nTrends are also shown for all data types in this/first visit columns, and you can of course click the red/green percentage next to any of them to graph historical data just like you can with any other report. Of note however is that we\'ve only been tracking this data for 3 days, so there isn\'t much history yet.<br />\n</ul><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>New visitor details page</h3>The old visitor details page did the job, but I used to refer to it as Old Betty if that tells you anything about my feelings towards it. I wanted to make it look nice, and add way more details to it. So... I did!<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201202-long-term-metrics/visitor-details.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li><b>Jam packed with details</b> - <a href=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201202-long-term-metrics/visitor-details-old.png\'>Click here</a> to see what this report used to look like, for the same visitor. There used to be a lot of wasted white space, with things like one line for browser, one for OS, and one for screen resolution. These are all related, so why not group together? Same with hostname/org, IP + ARIN/RIPE lookups, etc.<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>All time goals</b> - Everytime a unique visitor completes a goal for the very first time, we\'ve logged it to a table for over a year now I think. This was originally so we could calculate the time to goal and visits to goal metrics, making sure we were only counting each person once per goal. While making this new update, I realized how interesting this data could be. I can\'t believe we\'ve had it for as long as we have and never shown it to you like this. So, that\'s what this is. Every unique goal that this unique and beautiful snowflake has ever completed is shown here, in chronological order, with the date shown next to each one. Clicking on that date will take you to the session where they completed this goal!<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>This visit / first visit</b> - Just like the new goal report, we also show this kind of information in the visitor details pain now. So now whenever you\'re viewing the details for any of your visitors, you can immediately see interesting details from their first visit as well - including how long ago it was (in this example, 288 days and 15 hours ago). Want to see that first visit? Click on the date. Bam.<br />\n</ul><br />\n<br />\nOh, you thought we were done?<br />\n<br />\n<h3>New visitors report</h3><ul><li><b>Reorganization</b> - If you use goals or campaigns, icons for those were shown near the left for visitors who had either one attached to them. The problem with this is that most visitors <i>don\'t</i> have goals or campaigns attached, so this added a lot of empty white space in the middle of the report which always bothered me. So, we moved these icons to the very right hand side of the report. (This example is a bit cluttered because I filtered by visitors who had completed <i>any</i> goal, just to make sure there was lots of things to see).<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201202-long-term-metrics/visitors.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<li><b>Direct Spy access</b> - In the screenshot above, you\'ll see a third icon as well next to some visitors. What is this? Oh, it\'s only <i>the best thing ever!</i> If you\'re old school, you\'ll recognize this used to be the icon we had for the Spy report, before we removed the icons because we ran out of space. If you see this eye, that means that the visitor is online now, and you can click the icon to go straight to Spy with this visitor already pre-filtered! (If you don\'t have a premium account, you don\'t have Spy, so instead we just show a green dot icon indicating their online status).<br />\n<br />\n(My only problem here is that the eye icon is available as a choice to you when setting up goals and campaigns. So you might want to change that if you\'re using it for anything, to prevent confusion. But there is no better icon to represent what this new function does, so I had to use it. Had to.)<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>Quick access to visitor details</b> - So those visitor details I was just telling you about before? Well, there\'s no need to actually <i>go</i> to the visitor details page anymore, because they\'re now available directly on the main visitors report. Next to the actions link (e.g. 3 actions), is a grey arrow pointing top right. Click this icon and you\'ll immediately see the full visitor/session details page in a lightbox without having to go to a new page.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201202-long-term-metrics/visitor-popup.png\'><br />\n</ul><br />\n<br />\n<h3>Bonus</h3>The code that generates graphs when you click on a trend (those red/green percentages) was a mess and had been rewritten multiple times in several places for specific functionality. This is called horrible design. I took the time to rewrite it from scratch and it\'s way smarter and centralized in one place now, as it should be. Previously this code was unable to graph anything that had a parent/child relationship - for example, the this/first visit columns in the new goal report, that data is stored as children of the parent goal. I wouldn\'t have been able to let you graph this without rewriting this awful code. I really had no choice here.<br />\n<br />\nSo what\'s the bonus? Well, if you use our Twitter keyword monitoring, of course we keep history for all of that data - but we never showed you the trend percentage because we didn\'t want you to try to click it and have nothing happen (this data is stored with same parent/child relationship in the database). But since that mess is fixed, I have enabled the trends on the Twitter report, including the ability to graph any of them by clicking it. I use our Twitter monitoring a bit obsessively so, considering we released this feature almost 3 years ago, it\'s about damn time is all I have to say.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201202-long-term-metrics/twitter.png\'><br />\n<br />\n<h3>One more thing</h3>From a UX perspective, the fact that we graph both hourly and daily data using the same colors is confusing, because we only log some data as hourly, and we show hourly by default if we have it. The only solution I can think of is to have the two types be different colors, but I can\'t find anything that works with our overall color scheme. We have a heavy emphasis on blue and orange. So I tried changing one of them to orange, and it looked horrible (<a href=\'http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201202-long-term-metrics/my-eyes-they-bleed.png\'>screenshot</a>). I\'m just wondering if anyone has any ideas in this department, because I\'m at a loss.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Ok, one more</h3>In development for 2 months now is our path analysis feature. We\'re still working out the wiggles but expect it to be out within a few weeks and it will make an excellent partner to goals (although of course you will be able to use it without goals).<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHAPPY GROUNDHOG DAY!!!<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=gnUmyrSWVGQ:SfLUTYWdkEk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=gnUmyrSWVGQ:SfLUTYWdkEk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=gnUmyrSWVGQ:SfLUTYWdkEk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=gnUmyrSWVGQ:SfLUTYWdkEk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=gnUmyrSWVGQ:SfLUTYWdkEk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/gnUmyrSWVGQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Feb 2012 21:46:44 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1328161604\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://clicky.com/blog/286/long-term-metrics-and-other-goodies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Count your chickens while they&#039;re still hatching\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/M13GkCqNwLo/count-your-chickens-while-theyre-still-hatching\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"http://clicky.com/blog/285/count-your-chickens-while-theyre-still-hatching\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"http://clicky.com/blog/285/count-your-chickens-while-theyre-still-hatching\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2866:\"About 3 months ago, Google <a href=http://analytics.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-search-more-secure-accessing.html>announced</a> that all users logged in to their Google account, their search terms would be hidden from the referrer string when they clicked through. Net result is no trackers can see these search terms (surprisingly, this includes Google Analytics). Google says this is for privacy reasons. That\'s great, but I\'ve said a thousand times, search analytics is one of the best reasons to run analytics in the first place so it sucks for site owners.<br />\n<br />\nAnyways, the way our code processed blank search terms, they would show up like this:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201201-unknown-old.png><br />\n<br />\nThis has led to a lot of confusion and many people thinking Clicky is broken, because they weren\'t aware of this change on Google\'s end (understandable).<br />\n<br />\nGoogle updated their Analytics product to show the search as (Not provided) if it was blank. We\'ve decided to do the same thing, although we are labeling it as [unknown] instead:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201201-unknown.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>(Update: Per request, we changed this to <i>[secure search]</i> instead)</b><br />\n<br />\nThe main difference though is that this will now show up in your main searches report too. Previously blank searches just weren\'t logged in there. Now you will see an item for [unknown], and unfortunately it\'s probably pretty high on the list. For our own stats on getclicky.com, it\'s the #3 search term, representing about 1 out of every 6 searches.<br />\n<br />\nI wouldn\'t be surprised if Google made this the default for <i>all</i> searches on Google sites within the next year or two. Hence I say to you, count your chickens etc, because that will be a horrible day for site owners the world round.<br />\n<br />\nAt the very least however, I am happy to know that Google is not providing a back door to their own analytics product that allows them to log the searches but not anyone else. That would just be evil, not to mention anti-competitive.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=M13GkCqNwLo:CCC3nOSzWCY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=M13GkCqNwLo:CCC3nOSzWCY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=M13GkCqNwLo:CCC3nOSzWCY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=M13GkCqNwLo:CCC3nOSzWCY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=M13GkCqNwLo:CCC3nOSzWCY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/M13GkCqNwLo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Jan 2012 22:40:02 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1325745602\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"http://clicky.com/blog/285/count-your-chickens-while-theyre-still-hatching\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"Load balancing the load balancers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/vy7FptlHU74/load-balancing-the-load-balancers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://clicky.com/blog/284/load-balancing-the-load-balancers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://clicky.com/blog/284/load-balancing-the-load-balancers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3261:\"Load balancing your load balancers sounds a bit ridiculous but yes, that\'s what we have to do to scale.<br />\n<br />\nFor about three and a half years, we\'ve had a single pair of load balancers. One active, one in hot standby mode to take over if the active one goes offline. It\'s worked really well, but they were reaching capacity. I\'ve pulled all sorts of tricks out of my hat to reduce excess load, but the time finally arrived where new hardware was the only option left.<br />\n<br />\nSo, we just added two more load balancers to the equation. But these new ones are twice as powerful as the old ones, and instead of active/passive pairing, they\'re both active. This means we have a total of three active load balancers, and these are load balanced with DNS round robin, with DNS monitoring/failover on top of that to quickly and automatically remove one from the pool in case it has a problem. The old ones act as a front for our entire service with a bunch of virtual services running on them, and hence remain paired (keeping them in sync would otherwise be a nightmare). The new ones are just for additional tracking capacity and nothing else though, so this setup is great for us.<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking of tracking capacity, this just quintupled it to ~25,000 pageviews/second. Just in time too, because last year, online activity on Black Friday and <i>(cringe)</i> Cyber Monday sent a ton of extra traffic our way and knocked us offline for a bit. This year, we\'re ready, so bring it!<br />\n<br />\nSomething else we just changed today is that the static resources for our web site are no longer hosted on static.getclicky.com. A problem common with many trackers is that their domains are on blacklists of ad-blockers and other privacy software. These days, almost weekly we get an email from someone saying our site looks funny. This is because their browser, or their OS, or their ISP, or who knows, is blocking static.getclicky.com from loading anything, so the stylesheet doesn\'t get loaded (nor any of the images, javascript, etc).<br />\n<br />\nBut we\'ve had a secondary domain, staticstuff.net, that we\'ve used as a generic CDN domain for our <a href=http://getclicky.com/whitelabel/>white label</a> service for a while now. I had to change a few things around and get SSL running on it, but now that that\'s done, all assets for our web site (except the tracking code itself) will load from this domain instead. It points to the same servers, but it should bypass 99% of these blacklists because they are almost always based on domain name.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=vy7FptlHU74:0Fv8qhTj1mM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=vy7FptlHU74:0Fv8qhTj1mM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=vy7FptlHU74:0Fv8qhTj1mM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=vy7FptlHU74:0Fv8qhTj1mM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=vy7FptlHU74:0Fv8qhTj1mM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/vy7FptlHU74\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 01:28:14 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1321349294\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://clicky.com/blog/284/load-balancing-the-load-balancers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Google search rankings :D\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/2IoOGW9I64Y/google-search-rankings-d\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://clicky.com/blog/283/google-search-rankings-d\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://clicky.com/blog/283/google-search-rankings-d\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4196:\"Considering how much Google has been playing the privacy card recently, I\'m surprised they do this, but it turns out the referrer string for Google searches typically includes a variable in the URL, cd, which signifies the approximate ranking of the link someone clicked on to get to your site for a search term. e.g. 1 would mean your page was the top result.<br />\n<br />\nWe\'ve had requests to parse this data. As of about 20 minutes ago, we are now doing just that! (<a href=http://getclicky.com/user/upgrade>Pro+ account required</a>).<br />\n<br />\nNote that this is <i>passive</i>, in other words, we only have the data that Google gives us as people click through on search results. We\'re not scraping SERPs, and we only have this data from Google because they\'re the only ones who do this. (If any other major engines do it too, let us know and we\'ll try to add it). If you want scraped results, you should use our <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/196/search-keyword-rankings>SheerSEO integration</a>.<br />\n<br />\nThe screenshots below show how we report this data (5 different places - Spy is my favorite). Keep in mind the data shown in these screens is from our own stats and it\'s only been live for a short time so there\'s only a few results logged so far. But I took a peak at some super high traffic sites to see what the reports looked like there, and it\'s awesome.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, the ranking numbers you see for any given search are the average of all searches for that term. Not all visitors see the exact same search results! So if you had two people with a search and one saw it at position 4 and the other at position 5, the number reported would be 4.5.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, rankings integrated right into the main search report:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201111-rankings-searches.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBut of course there\'s also a report dedicated to just rankings, and in this case, they are sorted from best to worst rank (menu included in the screen so you can see where to go to get this):<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201111-rankings.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe integrated it into the keywords report too, so you can see your <i>average</i> ranking for any given single word. Note that the ranking numbers in this shot aren\'t accurate, since we\'re dividing the sum of all rankings for any word by the total number of searches for that word on that day, and since we only have ranking data for 20 minutes so far today, the divisor is out of proportion. Come tomorrow, it will be correct.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201111-rankings-keywords.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe also added it to the dashboard search module:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201111-rankings-dashboard.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAnd last but certainly not least, we put it in Spy, which is my absolute favorite. As live searches from Google stream in, we\'ll show you the ranking right there (if it\'s included in the referrer string). You might also notice we\'re now showing the search in the same way we used to with the old version of spy, where it\'s a separate string instead of just the full referrer string which is harder to read searches from:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201111-rankings-spy.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI freaking love this and hope you do too!!<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=2IoOGW9I64Y:H8NqT6nL9KE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=2IoOGW9I64Y:H8NqT6nL9KE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=2IoOGW9I64Y:H8NqT6nL9KE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=2IoOGW9I64Y:H8NqT6nL9KE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=2IoOGW9I64Y:H8NqT6nL9KE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/2IoOGW9I64Y\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Nov 2011 22:22:56 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1320992576\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"http://clicky.com/blog/283/google-search-rankings-d\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"Here&#039;s what&#039;s been happening\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/27i6m0XzD1c/heres-whats-been-happening\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://clicky.com/blog/282/heres-whats-been-happening\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://clicky.com/blog/282/heres-whats-been-happening\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16060:\"It\'s been a rough week. I wanted to explain what has been happening recently with our CDN, and talk about all of the problems we\'ve had with CDNs in general. If you can stomach a novel, you\'ll discover the good news that it\'s been resolved to the point where we don\'t foresee any further issues.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>The quest</h3>In June, we decided to move away from our <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/203/content-distribution-network-map>home brew CDN</a> and get a real one, because we were outgrowing it and it was becoming a real pain to manage amongst other things.<br />\n<br />\nThe main requirement was that we needed support for HTTPS with our own domain name (static.getclicky.com). There are surprisingly few CDN\'s out there that offer this service without selling your soul and first born child. Most CDN\'s only let you use a generic sub-domain of their CDN\'s domain to get HTTPS, such as omg-secure.somecdn.net. This is fine the assets on the CDN are only for your web site, but that obviously is not the case with us.<br />\n<br />\nLiterally the only two we could find that offered this feature at a reasonable price were <a href=http://cloudflare.com>CloudFlare</a> and <a href=http://maxcdn.com>MaxCDN</a>, so we decided to test these out. We also wanted to try one of the enterprise level ones, just to see the difference in performance. For this we chose the 800lb gorilla that is <a href=http://akamai.com>Akamai</a>.<br />\n<br />\nMaxCDN offers HTTPS for $99 setup + $99/month, on top of the normal bandwidth costs. Very reasonable. The service was perfectly fine, but they only have locations in the US and Europe. This is definitely a majority of our market but we wanted Asia too. Well, they do offer Asia, but you have to upgrade to their enterprise service, <a href=http://netdna.com>NetDNA</a>, for considerably more money. It was still less than what we were paying for our home brew CDN though, so I decided to try it.<br />\n<br />\nThis was one of the worst days I\'ve ever had. I didn\'t know when the transition was occurring, because I had to submit a ticket for it and then just wait. When they finished it, they let me know, but they messed up the configuration so the HTTPS didn\'t work. (They forgot the chain file. If you know how certificates work, that\'s kind of important). It was several hours before I realized this however, because DNS hadn\'t propagated yet - I was still hitting their old servers for a while, which were still working fine. Once I realized there was a problem, the damage had already been done to anyone who was tracking a secure site. Not to mention it completely broke our web site for our Pro+ members, since they get HTTPS interface by default and none of the assets were loading for them. I immediately emailed them to get it fixed, meanwhile I pointed the domain back to our old CDN so HTTPS would work in the meantime. But they never actually got it fixed. I don\'t know what the problem was, we had a lot of back and forth, but it was clear this was not going to work.<br />\n<br />\nNext was Cloudflare. I\'d met the founders at TechCrunch Disrupt the previous September, they\'re great. Thing is, they\'re not technically a pure CDN. You point your DNS to them, and then all of your site\'s traffic passes through their network. They automatically cache all of your static resources on their servers, and then accelerate your HTML / dynamic content. Accelerating means requests to your server pass through their network directly to speed them up, but they don\'t cache the actual HTML - it just gets to you faster because the route is optimized.<br />\n<br />\nAll in all it\'s a fantastic service, and I\'d be all for it, but they didn\'t (and still don\'t) support wildcard DNS - which is another do-or-die feature for us because of our <a href=http://getclicky.com/whitelabel/>white label analytics</a> service. But their rock star support guy, John, told me they could setup a special integration with us where we could just point a sub-domain to them to act as a traditional CDN. Well, it was worth trying because there weren\'t any other options at this price level, especially since HTTPS only costs <i>$1/month</i> on top of their normal pricing, and <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/network-map>they have servers in Asia too</a>. It seemed too good to be true really. How could they be doing this for such a great price and have such good support? I\'m pretty sure John doesn\'t sleep, no matter what time I email him I have a reply in minutes it seems.<br />\n<br />\nAnyways, the service worked great. We had it live for a week or two. At some point there was a problem that caused us to move back to our home brew CDN, although I don\'t recall what it was exactly. But overall I was happy and planned to test it again in the future, but I still had Akamai to test.<br />\n<br />\nAkamai is what the big boys use. Facebook, etc. I knew it was good, but also expensive. However, I figured it was worth it if the service was as good as I expected it to be. They literally have thousands of data centers, including South America and Africa which very very few CDN\'s have, and my speed tests on their edge servers were off the charts. Using <a href=http://just-ping.com>just-ping.com</a>, which tests response time from over 50 locations worldwide, I could barely find a single location that had higher than 10ms response time. Ridiculous to say the least.<br />\n<br />\nThey gave us a 90 day no commitment trial to test their service, which was appreciated. Their sales and engineer team were great. Very professional, timely, and helpful. But man did I hate their control panel. It was nothing short of the most confusing interface I have ever laid eyes on. I had no idea how to do anything, and I\'m usually the guy who figures that kind of thing out.<br />\n<br />\nThey walked me through a basic setup, but then the next thing I didn\'t like was discovered - any changes you want to make take 4 hours to deploy. What if you screw something up? That\'s gonna be a nail biting 4 hour ball of stress waiting for it to get fixed.<br />\n<br />\nI never actually got to really <i>test</i> their service because I was just too scared of screwing it up. A few weeks had passed and I had forgotten how to configure anything. My patience was wearing thin, as our custom CDN continued to deteriorate and I was dealing with other junk too. There\'s always a thousand things going on around here.<br />\n<br />\nJohn from Cloudflare continued to email me to ask how our testing was going with these other services. He was confident Cloudflare would meet our needs. I was pretty sure too, just hadn\'t made up my mind yet. But I decided to go back to them because I didn\'t have much other choice.<br />\n<br />\nThat was early August and, well, we\'ve been with them ever since. No problems at all. Great service. Overall I have nothing but good things to say.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>But then...</h3>Well, it turns out there was a problem. A few weeks ago, our pull server (that they pull static files from) crashed, and at the same time our tracking code stopped being served. It was fixed quickly but... How could this be? They should be caching <i>everything</i> from this server, right?<br />\n<br />\nI emailed them about it and they weren\'t sure how the server crashing would affect cached files being served. But unless the cache expired at the exact same time as the crash, something was definitely up.<br />\n<br />\nI did some digging and finally ended up watching the ifconfig output on the pull server, which shows bandwidth usage amongst other things. We were pushing almost 3MB per second of data out of that thing. Hmm, that doesn\'t seem right.<br />\n<br />\nI renamed the tracking code file as a quick test, and sure enough, suddenly Cloudflare wouldn\'t serve it. Put it back, bam, it worked.<br />\n<br />\nClearly this file was not being cached. But why? Well, it wasn\'t their fault. The problem was the rather strange URL for our tracking code. Instead of e.g. static.getclicky.com/track.js, the URL is just <a href=http://static.getclicky.com/js>static.getclicky.com/js</a>. This is one of those Why the hell did I ever do that type things, but is too late to change now with almost 400,000 sites already pointing to it.<br />\n<br />\nI emailed them about this and only then discovered that they cache based on file extension, not mime type or cache headers, which we of course properly serve. I wish I knew this beforehand, but wish in one hand shit in the other, see which one fills up first. <br />\n<br />\nAt this point I knew I needed to do something, since this single file was not being cached properly, it relied 100% on the single pull server being online at all times. I should have made it my #1 priority but with only a single 5 minute outage in 2 months, I somehow convinced myself I could think about it for a while. This was a big mistake on my part and I apologize profusely for it - it won\'t happen again. I could have spent a few grand with Dyn to get failover immediately to give us a safeguard until I found the right (affordable) solution, but I didn\'t (more on this in a second). I\'m really sorry and I won\'t compromise our reliability like that again. Clearly it was not worth it.<br />\n<br />\nSo anyways, the same day I discover this caching issue, the server crashed... again. I got it fixed quickly, and as a quick precaution I setup another server and setup round robin DNS to serve both IPs so in case one crashed, there\'d be backup. However there was not monitoring/failover on this config, but if DNS serves multiple IPs for a domain, theoretically the requester is supposed to fall back on the second one if the first one fails. I had never actually tested this scenario, but it was just an intermittent fingers-crossed fix until I got a real solution in place.<br />\n<br />\nAnd then the server crashed again... and I discovered this did not work as I hoped (surprise).<br />\n<br />\nOk, so we need failover on this, like yesterday. This is now my #1 priority. Our DNS provider, <a href=http://dyn.com/>Dyn</a>, offers this feature, but what I hate about their implementation is the restrictions they place on the TTL (time to live), which is how long DNS will cache a query for. Obviously the TTL should be fairly short for maximum uptime, but the max they allow you to set with failover is 7.5 minutes. And with our level of traffic, this increases our bill several thousand dollars a month which is a bit steep for my liking. Not to mention the expensive monthly base fee just to have this feature enabled in the first place.<br />\n<br />\n<h3>The plan</h3>I finally came up with a plan though. I found another DNS provider, <a href=http://dnsmadeeasy.com>DNSMadeEasy.com</a>, that offers monitoring/failover for very reasonable pricing and no restrictions on TTL. I specifically emailed them about this like 4 times to confirm it would work exactly as I expected. However I can\'t just transfer getclicky.com to be hosted there, because we\'re in a contract with Dyn (sigh). So I was going to setup a different domain on their servers, and then using CNAME\'s, point Cloudflare to pull files from <i>that</i> domain, instead of the sub-domain we were using for getclicky.com.<br />\n<br />\nThat was yesterday. Great!, I said to myself. I\'ll set it up first thing tomorrow because it\'s almost midnight!<br />\n<br />\nAnd then this morning.......... that\'s right, the freaking server crashed again. My phone was on silent by accident and I slept in, so for almost 2 hours our tracking code was only being served for about 75% of requests (because DNS IP fallback does work some of the time, it seems). Hence, more problems this morning.<br />\n<br />\nARGH. I screamed at my computer and just about burned down my house I was so mad. I had come up with a plan that I knew would work and was going to implement it first thing the next day, but the server crashes in the meantime and here I am in bed, blissfully dreaming of puppies and unicorns, unaware of any problems because my <i>STUPID PHONE IS ON SILENT. WHY. ME.</i><br />\n<br />\n<h3>The fix</h3>But the good news is, today, I got this all setup. Monitoring/failover is now live on our pull servers, and they are checked every 2 minutes - so if there is a problem with any of them, DNS will stop serving that IP to Cloudflare within 2 minutes at the most, and I verified it works properly by intentionally killing a server. And the TTL is only 5 minutes, so the <i>absolute maximum</i> amount of time there could potentially be a problem for any individual person is 7 minutes. And we added a <i>third</i> pull server, so at the most this would only affect 1/3 of anyone, and even then, for a maximum of 7 minutes.<br />\n<br />\n(Note: Above I was complaining about Dyn\'s 7.5 minute max TTL, and here I am with a 5 minute one. Well, this one\'s a bit different because only Cloudflare\'s servers talk to it, so the total queries generated are quite small. The real issue is we\'re also going to be doing this same thing in order to load balance the load balancers (really?), because we\'re adding two more of them this week. Using failover on <i>this</i> is what would be really expensive, so we\'re avoiding that by using another DNS provider for it, and we figure we might as well do all of that monitoring and failover in one place. Load balancers are stable and reliable, so the TTL will be a bit higher - and even if not, their pricing is considerably cheaper than Dyn\'s, so it\'s all good).<br />\n<br />\nOn top of all that, Cloudflare desperately wants to fix this caching problem on their end too. (I say problem in quotes because their service is working exactly as they designed it to work, I just didn\'t know ahead of time that caching was based on file extension only). They are working on a solution that will allow us to rewrite URLs on their end so that their servers will see the tracking code file as something that ends with a .js file extension and hence cache it properly, without us having to make any changes on our end. Once that\'s live, even if all 3 of our pull servers were offline (knock on wood), it should have zero impact because that stupid legacy URL file will be actually be cached!<br />\n<br />\n<h3>In conclusion</h3>So that, my friends, is as short a summary as I can write about everything we\'ve been through with CDNs.<br />\n<br />\nAnd on top of all this, we also <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/281/iframe-tracking-copying-dashboards-google-search-encoding-etc>made an update</a> to the tracking code on Nov 1 that caused issues for some of you. This update has been reverted but that was the last thing we needed with the CDN also causing issues at the same time. [Update: And there was a small network hiccup at our data center on Nov 9 that caused a short outage. Worst week <i>ever</i>.]<br />\n<br />\nSo I don\'t really feel like we have earned your money this month (and to think, it\'s only the 8th...) If anyone wants a refund, send us an email we\'ll happily refund you a full month of service.<br />\n<br />\nNo matter what, know that I value the quality of our service above anything else and will always do everything in my power to make sure it works flawlessly. This has been a horrible week, but as of now the CDN should not impact anyone.<br />\n<br />\nThanks for reading and (hopefully) understanding.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=27i6m0XzD1c:WnDPonxDr4g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=27i6m0XzD1c:WnDPonxDr4g:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=27i6m0XzD1c:WnDPonxDr4g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=27i6m0XzD1c:WnDPonxDr4g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=27i6m0XzD1c:WnDPonxDr4g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/27i6m0XzD1c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Nov 2011 01:48:57 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1320832137\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://clicky.com/blog/282/heres-whats-been-happening\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"iframe tracking, copying dashboards, Google search encoding, etc\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/_8o6Adird7o/iframe-tracking-copying-dashboards-google-search-encoding-etc\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"http://clicky.com/blog/281/iframe-tracking-copying-dashboards-google-search-encoding-etc\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"http://clicky.com/blog/281/iframe-tracking-copying-dashboards-google-search-encoding-etc\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3784:\"It\'s new feature Tuesday!<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Better iframe support</h4>A common problem we have is that people can only install the tracking code inside an iframe, but they want to track the parent document, not the iframe. But unfortunately this only tracks the iframe itself. Now I know there are plenty of people who want to track the iframe specifically, but there are <i>way</i> more people in the other camp. So now, by default, our tracking code will detect if it\'s in an iframe and use the parent documents URL and title instead of the iframe\'s. This is already what most other services do by default.<br />\n<br />\nThere is a way to override it though if you are actually wanting to track the iframe on purpose, via the new <a href=http://getclicky.com/help/customization#iframe>clicky_custom.iframe</a> property.<br />\n<br />\n[<b>Nov 3 update:</b> This change may have caused general tracking problems for some sites. We tested it, as we always do, against all major browsers before deployment and it worked fine, but something with it is causing problems for some of you, so the change has been reverted. We will look to add it back in the future.]<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Copying dashboards between sites</h4>If you have a bunch of sites, you may have created the most awesome amazing <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/276/multiple-dashboards-and-custom-dashboard-modules>customized dashboard</a> ever. And then you have to recreate it for every site in your account. So fun!<br />\n<br />\nWell, now when you go to your customize dashboard page, there will also be a list of all the dashboards you\'ve created for your other sites. One click and bam, that dashboard is now copied into the new site. After it\'s copied you can edit it if you want, or just leave as is.<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Google search encoding</h4>Some change Google made to their URL structure is resulting in double URL encoding, and you might be seeing <i>searches+like+this</i> instead of <i>searches like this</i>. It\'s not just affecting us either, I checked my Google Analytics account (gasp!) and was seeing the same thing. As of today, we now just double URL <i>de</i>code all searches before storing them, so this problem is history. I imagine Google will fix it on their end eventually but patience is not one of my virtues.<br />\n<br />\n<h4>Black nav bar</h4>We know some of you don\'t like this but we feel it\'s important to have these links highly visible and easy to find. If you stick something in a footer, no one clicks the links because no one sees them. Two designs ago, when we actually had a footer, as soon as we moved a bunch of those links into the sidebar we added, the number of clicks each one was getting skyrocketed. I\'m talking 10-20x as much activity. That\'s a good thing.<br />\n<br />\nBut anyways, today, I reduced the padding so it takes up a bit less space, and also removed the position:fixed style rule so it\'s not <i>always</i> on the screen, instead it\'s only visible when the page is scrolled up all the way. I hope that appeases some of you to a small degree at the very least.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=_8o6Adird7o:a2NIRYihKtE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=_8o6Adird7o:a2NIRYihKtE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=_8o6Adird7o:a2NIRYihKtE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=_8o6Adird7o:a2NIRYihKtE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=_8o6Adird7o:a2NIRYihKtE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/_8o6Adird7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Nov 2011 13:05:31 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1320177931\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"http://clicky.com/blog/281/iframe-tracking-copying-dashboards-google-search-encoding-etc\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"More ways to view hourly data... and more!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/MN6CDCkpwts/more-ways-to-view-hourly-data-and-more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"http://clicky.com/blog/280/more-ways-to-view-hourly-data-and-more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"http://clicky.com/blog/280/more-ways-to-view-hourly-data-and-more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3272:\"We just deployed a bunch of changes to hourly data, amongst other things:<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li><b>Goals and Revenue now support hourly data</b>, so you can more easily see your best converting and most profitable times of day.

Even when they <a href=http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/30/linkedin-traffic-twitter/>state the obvious reasons</a> (HTTPS sends no referrer, 99% of people use Twitter apps which also send no referrer, etc), they brush them off and pretend no one uses Twitter.<br />\n<br />\nI\'m not here to defend Twitter, but they just made a big change that almost 100% guarantees headlines like the one we\'re using here.<br />\n<br />\nWhat am I blathering on about? I can\'t exactly tell <i>what</i> Twitter changed, as I never paid attention to t.co really, but either they finally started actually routing <i>every</i> link through their shortener, t.co, or they changed the way t.co redirects. The bottom line is this: you will pretty much never see a single referrer from twitter.com again. Instead you will be seeing t.co. (At least from non-Clicky analytics services - more on that in minute).<br />\n<br />\nThe reason is because of the way t.co redirects. Instead of using a 301 redirect, which every shortener <i>should</i> do, they are using a combination of a META redirect and Javascript to send you on your merry way. If you click a t.co link and hit escape really fast, your browser will pause on that page, allowing you to see the source:<br />\n<br />\nnoscriptMETA http-equiv=refresh content=0;URL=http://www.addedbytes.com/blog/if-php-were-british//noscriptscriptlocation.replace(http://www.addedbytes.com/blog/if-php-were-british/)/script<br />\n<br />\nThe problem is that both META redirects and Javascript redirects overwrite the original referrer. The referrer becomes the page with that code on it. Hence, no more twitter.com referrals, because every single link passes through t.co now.<br />\n<br />\nHere are screenshots of our 30 day history of referral traffic for twitter.com vs t.co. Notice the last 3 days, twitter.com is zero, and t.co has come out of essentially nowhere:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-twitter-tco.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>What to do?</h3>We just updated Clicky to convert t.co referrers into twitter.com automatically. Knowing the specific t.co link someone came from has no value, but knowing someone came from Twitter does. No other analytics service has done this yet that we know of, so as usual our tiny size lets us move lightning fast to address issues like this.<br />\n<br />\n[Update: ok, we changed it back. See comments.]<br />\n<br />\n<i>But wait there\'s more!</i> There\'s a damn nice silver lining here. The main reason twitter.com doesn\'t show up as a referral much, even before this change, is because so many people use apps instead of the actual twitter web site. When you click a link in an app, that app passes the URL to your browser, which then opens it - but that means no referrer.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, now that all links are being passed through t.co, and this happens via the API as well (I confirmed via our own Twitter keyword monitoring feature), this means that even people who click links from apps will be passing through t.co first. If we automatically convert t.co links into twitter.com in the backend, this means we will be able to give you a MUCH more accurate picture of Twitter\'s traffic to your web site. (We just pushed this change so we can\'t guarantee this will be the case, but based on what we\'ve analyzed, if you use Clicky you should start seeing a huge influx of twitter.com referrals).<br />\n<br />\nThis may even be the reason that they\'re doing redirect this way, because they\'re sick of the uninformed media saying they have no influence. By having a ton of t.co hits suddenly showing up in referrer logs, maybe the media will consider what that means. Doubtful, but one can always hope.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=qpG57DF-YM0:XTQ0SX_8QUg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=qpG57DF-YM0:XTQ0SX_8QUg:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=qpG57DF-YM0:XTQ0SX_8QUg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=qpG57DF-YM0:XTQ0SX_8QUg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=qpG57DF-YM0:XTQ0SX_8QUg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/qpG57DF-YM0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 Aug 2011 10:49:05 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1313862545\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"http://clicky.com/blog/274/breaking-twitters-influence-is-now-zero-facebook-wins-all-hail-the-zuck\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"JW Player tracking, and other recent changes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/fOkkLBL6oeU/jw-player-tracking-and-other-recent-changes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://clicky.com/blog/272/jw-player-tracking-and-other-recent-changes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"http://clicky.com/blog/272/jw-player-tracking-and-other-recent-changes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2220:\"Since we released video analytics last year, the number 1 request has been to add a library for tracking JW Player.

We don\'t normally make a blog post just for this type of junk, instead preferring to piggyback on top of another post, so here we go:<br />\n<br />\n- NEW: Checkbox on the tracking code page to disable affiliate badge (for paying members)<br />\n- NEW: Email reports are now in your selected language, instead of English for everyone.<br />\n- NEW: go.mail.ru is a search engine, not a web mail domain - yes, we hear you :)<br />\n- FIXED: Tracking code pings now end at 10 minutes as stated in the docs, rather than 8 minutes and 40 seconds (this was a math fail on our end)<br />\n- FIXED: The Flashy widget was broken.<br />\n- FIXED: After editing site prefs, you may have seen a message about your site being disabled.<br />\n- FIXED: Y-axis text in charts was getting truncated for values over 6 digits.<br />\n- FIXED: Loading a site, changing to a different site, then choosing Bigscreen would load that for the FIRST site.<br />\n- FIXED: Non-paying users who use our Wordpress plugin, viewing stats within the WP admin area didn\'t count as a login so they were getting disabled after 60 days of no logins.

The most major update is to alerts, so we\'re pulling that out of the blackhole that is your site preferences and putting it front and center, as you can see on the right.<br />\n<br />\nSo what\'s new? Here\'s what the alert setup page looks like now, which should give you a nice overview of everything that\'s new:<br />\n<br />\n<img class=ml20 src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-alerts/setup.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nLet\'s start with the new ways to be notified: Desktop, Sound, and <a href=http://clickytouch.com>ClickyTouch</a> (our official unofficial iOS app). These are in addition to the previous methods, which are Email and Twitter. Any alert you setup can use any combination of these 5 methods, including all of them, so it would be pretty much impossible to miss an alert if you set it up right!<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li><b>Desktop alerts</b> - You may have seen some web apps using Google Chrome notifications (Tweetdeck, Rdio, etc). We explored this option, alongside using <a href=http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jGrowl>jGrowl</a> for other browsers, but I\'ll be honest: The Chrome notification API is horrible and has very limited options and functionality. It\'s nice you can see them without having to have the browser in focus, but that\'s the only nice thing about them. So, jGrowl for all. (I\'m aware the screenshot above mentions the ability to enable Chrome alerts - it is from a few days ago when that feature was still in place, so the shot is simply out of date and I\'m way too exhausted to make a new one - sorry!)<br />\n<br />\nDesktop alerts will appear in the bottom right corner of your browser window. Here\'s what they look like:<br />\n<br />\n<img class=fl mr20 src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-alerts/alert-onsite.png>At the top is the alert name. If there\'s any revenue associated with this alert (from a goal), that will shown on this line too. Next line is brief details about the visitor: country, then IP tag OR <a href=https://secure.getclicky.com/help/customization#session>custom->username</a> OR organization OR IP address (in that order of preference), then their referrer. The last line is a link to view the session immediately on Clicky. And on the bottom right is a mute link, which is handy when you just want some piece and quiet to browse your stats. When alerts are muted, there\'s a sticky box in the bottom right corner (which you can see in the setup screen above) informing you of their muted status, with the ability to unmute them.<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>Sound</b> - These add a lot of personality to alerts, and allow you to know an alert has been triggered even when you\'re looking at another tab or doing something else on your computer. Example sound: <a href=# onclick=document.getElementById(\'example_sound\').play(); return false;>Cash register</a><audio id=example_sound preload=auto><source type=audio/mp3 src=http://getclicky.com/media/audio/cash_register.mp3 /><source type=audio/ogg src=http://getclicky.com/media/audio/cash_register.ogg /></audio> - perfect for goals where you make money! There\'s a total of about 20 sounds available.<br />\n<br />\n<li><img class=fr ml20 src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-alerts/clickytouch.png><b>ClickyTouch</b> - The icing on the cake. <a href=http://clickytouch.com>ClickyTouch</a> is a third party product for iOS that uses our API to give you a nice interface for Clicky on the go. We worked with <a href=http://reynoldsftw.com>Steve</a> (the developer) to integrate push alerts into the app. So if you have ClickyTouch installed and check this box for an alert, you can get alerts immediately on your iPhone or iPad, wherever you are. And if you view the alert, it will pop open ClickyTouch and show you the visitor session that triggered it.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Important</b> - to receive alerts on ClickyTouch, you must update to 1.5.2, which was just released in the app store alongside this release.<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>Email and Twitter</b> - These are the original alerting methods we\'ve had for over a year and they still work the same way. You can receive alerts via email or Twitter direct message. To get alerts via Twitter, you must be <a href=http://twitter.com/getclicky>following Clicky on Twitter</a>.</ul><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to these new methods of being alerted, we\'ve added two new types of alerts:<br />\n<br />\n<ul><li><b>New visitors</b> - This is an extension of <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/268/spy-preferences-and-sound-effects>new visitor sounds in Spy</a> we added a few weeks back. That method only worked in Spy. This method works no matter what report or page you are viewing. But the option to toggle it on and off is still available in Spy as well. If you enable it via Spy, by default it will only be the traditional ding sound. But if you set it up in the alerts area instead (or edit it after enabling via Spy), you can have it to a desktop alert also or instead. To ensure we don\'t inadvertently hammer third party mail servers and APIs, this alert ONLY works with sound and desktop - the other three options are disabled.<br />\n<br />\n<li><b>Custom data / IP tags</b> - We\'ve had countless requests for alerts for when a specific visitor is viewing your site. This is the answer to that. Any visitor that you have named with IP tags, you can now create an alert for them. Even better, if you use our <a href=https://secure.getclicky.com/help/customization#session>custom data tracking API</a> (and if you\'re not, you\'re crazy - it\'s our best feature), then you can trigger an alert for ANY custom data that you add to a visitor session.</ul><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nI want to talk more about desktop and sound alerts for a minute. To be clear, since these are integrated <i>into</i> the web site itself, these only work when you have our web site open. But if you\'re anything like us, that\'s pretty much 24x7, so no biggie, right?<br />\n<br />\nDepending on how many alerts are queued up to show you, they are visible for either 6 seconds or 10 seconds. We only do one at a time though, so as long as there are less than 6 queued up (and 99% of the time, that should be the case, unless you are insane), then they\'ll be displayed for 10 seconds. Originally it was 6 no matter what but I found myself racing to find what an alert was for if I wasn\'t looking at the site when I heard the ding, so I decided it was much better to have them visible for a longer period of time when there\'s only a few to show.<br />\n<br />\nWhen you are viewing reports for just one specific site (e.g. whenever you\'re inside the /stats/ directory), you will only receive alerts for that specific site. But if you are anywhere else on the site - user homepage, help, contact, etc - then alerts for ALL of your sites will be active. And in this case, we append the site\'s name to the end of the alert title, so you know what site it\'s for, as can be seen here:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-alerts/alert-global.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Goals</h3>We cleaned up the goal setup page quite a bit, so only the basic options that most of you need are up top, with the rest in the advanced section. And as you can see by this example alert name, we now allow global wildcards, meaning the entire goal can be <i>just</i> a wildcard. In this case, ANY page view will trigger the goal. You can do the same thing with funnels, as well as search and referrer alerts (which are different from the ones in goal, because in goals they can only be funnels. This is perhaps another area we could clean up a bit. It would be nice to setup a goal for a specific search instead of only being able to use that search as a funnel).<br />\n<br />\nYou can also see that we\'ve added a shortcut to create an alert for a goal as well after you\'ve saved it. This takes you to the alert setup page, with the alert name prepopulated to match the goal name, and the goal alert type with the proper goal preselected.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-alerts/goals-setup.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>Spy</h3>We spent a LOT of time integrating all of this new alerting into Spy as well. Not many of you know this but Spy is essentially a completely different product from the rest of Clicky. It is a true live stream of people browsing your site, whereas the rest of your reports are updated once per minute in batches using this same data. So, to make sure the alerts in Spy were triggered at the exact same time you see a visitor performing something in Spy that should trigger an alert, we had to write another entirely new version of the whole alerting system in Javascript - just for Spy. These alerts don\'t show the visitor details in the actual alert box though, since those are shown on the Spy page itself at the exact same time.<br />\n<br />\n<i>But wait, there\'s more!</i> We thought it would be quite nice to actually highlight the goals in Spy as well. As you can see here, the row is highlighted, and the goal icon you chose is on the right hand side:<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-alerts/spy.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThis was also quite a bit of work, because again, we had to rewrite the <i>goal code</i> in Javascript as well. I love me some Javascript but this was <i>ridiculous</i>. One of our developers, this was 95% of his time on this project over 2 weeks - processing goals and alerts in just Spy. Dynamic goals, manual goals, funnels, more than once goals - it all works. The only thing that doesn\'t work are <i>campaign</i> funnels, because of various challenges we encountered when trying to implement them.<br />\n<br />\nDesktop and sound alerts work the exact same way here as they do in the rest of Clicky, so I\'m not including a screenshot of that here.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3>What about Bigscreen?</h3>You don\'t think we\'d leave one of our newest most popular features high and dry, do you? That\'s right, alerts even work in <a href=http://getclicky.com/blog/262/big-screen-mode-faster-page-loads>Bigscreen</a>, as you can see below. We made the fonts extra big so you could read them from afar. The alert visible here is the new new visitor alert, mentioned above. As you can see, no visitor details are shown. I wanted to touch on this briefly. The reason is because there may be 100 new visitors every minute, so this is more of a batch alert. In other words, you can read it as 1 or more visitors have arrived since the last time you saw this alert. Because of this, it is a bit generic. Maybe we\'ll clean that up a bit in the future but for now, this made sense.<br />\n<br />\n<img src=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/201108-alerts/bigscreen.png><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWe\'ve tested this very thoroughly but we do expect there to be some minor bugs, especially with the Spy stuff. So let us know if something doesn\'t work like you expect it to.<br />\n<br />\nLast, when creating alerts, there\'s up to a 30 minute delay before they are fully active within the system, so be patient -- and enjoy!<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<h3 id=alertupdate>Update</h3>Yes, there were some bugs. Just pushed an update that fixes them. Changes:<br />\n- FIXED: Spy was showing URL instead of Title in the top right content box<br />\n- FIXED: Unmute alert box was MIA because of last minute change to the way it works that wasn\'t fully testing before deploy<br />\n- FIXED: global alert bombardment when leaving /stats/ - now, all alerts are reset when you go to a non-stats page so you\'ll only get new ones that occur from that point onward.<br />\n- FIXED: clicking an alert URL was supposed to load via Ajax, but was not because of, well, it was dumb let\'s just leave it at that.<br />\n- FIXED: Minor goal processing bugs in Spy<br />\n- NEW FEATURE! You can use wildcards in the custom data alert type, including a global wildcard * to match a visitor with that variable of ANY value, e.g. username=ANYTHING.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=7LL04PG_2jo:eTYIfs78UNM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=7LL04PG_2jo:eTYIfs78UNM:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=7LL04PG_2jo:eTYIfs78UNM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=7LL04PG_2jo:eTYIfs78UNM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=7LL04PG_2jo:eTYIfs78UNM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/7LL04PG_2jo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:08:25 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1312927705\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://clicky.com/blog/271/major-updates-to-alerts-goals-and-spy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"Important change to goals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/getclicky/~3/qQ18J0byulg/important-change-to-goals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://clicky.com/blog/270/important-change-to-goals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"http://clicky.com/blog/270/important-change-to-goals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2221:\"Goals have always been exact match by default, and only used any kind of wildcard matching if you specifically added that in. We thought this was the best way to do it but over the years, we\'ve found that the vast vast majority of support requests that have to do with goals are because the user is not using wildcards where they should, usually on the end of the string.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, a user might enter /thankyou.php as their goal URL, without realizing (or simply forgetting) that these types of pages typically have query parameters too. Then their goal wouldn\'t work, so they\'d contact us, and adding a wildcard on the end was almost always the only change needed. Sometimes a wildcard is needed at the start though as well, but usually just the end.<br />\n<br />\nSo, as of now, all goals by default will be processed as if they had a wildcard at the start, and at the end. We know this won\'t work for everyone of course, so we added a new checkbox to the goal setup page called exact match. This will force the old behavior, but it is off by default (based on our analysis of how you have setup goals, very few of you will need it). We also expect quite a few people who setup goals but they never worked to suddenly find them start working as if magic has occurred.<br />\n<br />\nWhile we were at it, we also fixed a few long outstanding bugs: https:// goals used to not work, and depending on how goals were setup, sometimes they were case sensitive which was quite obnoxious. These are both fixed.<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=qQ18J0byulg:0b_Kc-0fTPk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img

This is a Clicky-wide setting too, so any site you\'re looking at or any account you\'re logged into from the same computer - bam.<br />\n<br />\nWe\'ve also added a request we\'ve had more often than we would expect, which is having a sound effect play when a new visitor arrives. This is of course DISABLED by default.

Of course you will need a browser released within the last couple of years for it to work, but thankfully our userbase is quite good at abandoning old, depressing technology.

Now that we can just use a replica of our web site, that\'s what we\'re doing with the PDFs.<br />\n<br />\nOne thing we\'ll also be adding in the near future is the ability to be viewing any report and just export it to PDF immediately - like you can currently do with CSV/XML exports.<br />\n<br />\n<a href=http://static.getclicky.com/media/screenshots/2011-07-18-blog.pdf>Click here to view a sample PDF report</a><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=837At58caao:0xBusCYsavA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=837At58caao:0xBusCYsavA:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=837At58caao:0xBusCYsavA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?i=837At58caao:0xBusCYsavA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?a=837At58caao:0xBusCYsavA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/getclicky?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/getclicky/~4/837At58caao\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 Jul 2011 16:20:19 -0800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:5:\"bonus\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"1311117619\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:8:\"origLink\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"http://clicky.com/blog/267/pdf-email-reports\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";s:4:\"href\";s:37:\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/getclicky\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:2:{s:3:\"rel\";s:3:\"hub\";s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:42:\"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0\";a:1:{s:4:\"info\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:3:\"uri\";s:9:\"getclicky\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:9:{s:12:\"content-type\";s:28:\"text/xml; charset=ISO-8859-1\";s:4:\"etag\";s:27:\"dkH92jKD7VyhMYDWfN4bN8xkWM0\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 06 Feb 2013 18:03:59 GMT\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 06 Feb 2013 18:04:34 GMT\";s:7:\"expires\";s:29:\"Wed, 06 Feb 2013 18:04:34 GMT\";s:13:\"cache-control\";s:18:\"private, max-age=0\";s:22:\"x-content-type-options\";s:7:\"nosniff\";s:16:\"x-xss-protection\";s:13:\"1; mode=block\";s:6:\"server\";s:3:\"GSE\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20121213170216\";}','no'),(3110,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_57bc725ad6568758915363af670fd8bc','1365947677','no'),(3111,'_transient_feed_mod_57bc725ad6568758915363af670fd8bc','1365904477','no'),(3114,'_transient_timeout_dash_de3249c4736ad3bd2cd29147c4a0d43e','1365947677','no'),(3115,'_transient_dash_de3249c4736ad3bd2cd29147c4a0d43e','<h4>Most Popular</h4>\n<h5><a href=\'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\'>Advanced Custom Fields</a></h5>&nbsp;<span>(<a href=\'plugin-install.php?tab=plugin-information&amp;plugin=advanced-custom-fields&amp;_wpnonce=159077cae6&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;width=600&amp;height=800\' class=\'thickbox\' title=\'Advanced Custom Fields\'>Install</a>)</span>\n<p>Fully customise WordPress edit screens with powerful fields.

After talking to  community members and leaders, we saw a community-wide willingness to go ‘the extra mile’ during the holiday season. So that sparked a question in our minds:  how can we facilitate this philanthropic spirit year round?\n\nWe realized a way to reduce that extra mile to an extra foot was through utilizing social platforms. We seek to combine social networking and philanthropy to unite the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago.\n\nSee our FAQ section for what types of donation and volunteer opportunities you can use our site for, along with other frequently asked questions.\n\n[button url=\"register\" color=\"orange\" ]New to Our Site? <strong>Register Now</strong>[/button]\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <strong>THE FOUNDERS</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://communilinkchicago.org/about-communilink-chicago/dsc_0107\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-150\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-150\" alt=\"DSC_0107\" src=\"http://communilinkchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0107-300x239.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">From left to right - Katie, Natalie, &amp; Tim</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"> CommuniLink was founded by Natalie Bounassar, Katie D’Amico, and Tim Zachas in 2012.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Natalie is a future media-mogul with a philanthropic heart. She has been dually called to the arts and philanthropy for her entire life, and saw the chance to apply the project management and communications skills she developed from her extensive work experience to CommuniLink. Natalie will graduate from Columbia College Chicago in May of 2013 with a degree in Media Management. She plans on working with Windy City Live! after graduation.</p>\nKatie was born with a passion for business and bringing about positive change.  After working with various businesses and gaining a diverse skill set, she found the need to apply these skills for the good of her community. Katie graduated in December of 2012 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in Finance and Environmental Economics &amp; Law. She will be working at Deloitte Consulting beginning this winter.\n\nTim has a passion for growing organizations. After developing his skill set through internships in strategy consulting and finance, he saw the opportunity to use his learnings to grow an organization in his local community that has the power to give back. Tim will graduate in June of 2013 from Northwestern University with a degree in Economics and Learning &amp; Organizational Change.

After talking to  community members and leaders, we saw a community-wide willingness to go ‘the extra mile’ during the holiday season. So that sparked a question in our minds:  how can we facilitate this philanthropic spirit year round?\r\n\r\nWe realized a way to reduce that extra mile to an extra foot was through utilizing social platforms. We seek to combine social networking and philanthropy to unite the Northwest Suburbs of Chicago.\r\n\r\nSee our FAQ section for what types of donation and volunteer opportunities you can use our site for, along with other frequently asked questions.\r\n\r\n[button url=\"register\" color=\"orange\" ]New to Our Site? <strong>Register Now</strong>[/button]\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <strong>THE FOUNDERS</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://communilinkchicago.org/about-communilink-chicago/dsc_0107\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-150\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-150\" alt=\"DSC_0107\" src=\"http://communilinkchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0107-300x239.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"239\" /></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">From left to right - Katie, Natalie, &amp; Tim</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"> CommuniLink was founded by Natalie Bounassar, Katie D’Amico, and Tim Zachas in 2012.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Natalie is a future media-mogul with a philanthropic heart. She has been dually called to the arts and philanthropy for her entire life, and saw the chance to apply the project management and communications skills she developed from her extensive work experience to CommuniLink. Natalie will graduate from Columbia College Chicago in May of 2013 with a degree in Media Management. She plans on working with Harpo Productions after graduation.</p>\r\nKatie was born with a passion for business and bringing about positive change.  After working with various businesses and gaining a diverse skill set, she found the need to apply these skills for the good of her community. Katie graduated in December of 2012 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in Finance and Environmental Economics &amp; Law. She will be working at Deloitte Consulting beginning this winter.\r\n\r\nTim has a passion for growing organizations. After developing his skill set through internships in strategy consulting and finance, he saw the opportunity to use his learnings to grow an organization in his local community that has the power to give back. Tim will graduate in June of 2013 from Northwestern University with a degree in Economics and Learning &amp; Organizational Change. He will be working in strategy consulting with The Cambridge Group upon graduation.','About CommuniLink Chicago','','publish','open','open','','about-communilink-chicago','','','2013-02-18 00:11:39','2013-02-18 00:11:39','',0,'http://communilinkchicago.org/communilink/?page_id=61',0,'page','',0),(60,1,'2012-12-04 03:11:00','2012-12-04 03:11:00','CommuniLink is a web-based resource that strives to improve the lives of those in need by connecting them with donors in their community.

Therefore, individuals looking to receive goods through CommuniLink should work with their local organization.

CommuniLink is a third party platform dedicated to matching household good donations with those in need. We do not claim ownership of any of the items listed on our site. However, if you find an organization using our tool that sparks your interest, feel free to contact them directly to make a monetary donation!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Q:</b> You keep saying you accept “household goods.” Can you define household goods?\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> We’d be happy to!

Some examples include dressers, lamps, pots and pans, etc.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Q:</b> I’m an organization acting on behalf of someone in need. What kinds of items can I request?\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> You may request household goods (see definition above) and clothing. Food pantries may put out requests for food. You may NOT request monetary donations. Any such posts seen will be deleted.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Q:</b> How can I delete my posting?\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> Directly beneath your post, you’ll see the options to ‘Comment,’ ‘Favorite,’ and ‘Delete.” Click delete.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Q:</b> Does my post expire?\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> Your post will not expire! However, if you haven’t received a response to a post listed several weeks prior, we encourage you to repost. Activity on the site will push your listing to the bottom and sometimes next page. A new post will ensure visibility.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Q:</b> How often can I post a donation or request an item?\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> Donations are always welcome! Requests are as well, however we encourage you to share the wealth. J\r\n\r\n<b>Q:</b> Can I post a request anonymously?\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> We require that organizations identify themselves when registering, so anonymous requests are prohibited.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Q:</b> Can I list a donation anonymously?\r\n\r\n<b>A:</b> Yes!
